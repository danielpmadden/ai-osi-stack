# Call to Action: Governance as Infrastructure

## Why Act Now
Federal agencies, state governments, and philanthropic partners face mounting pressure to provide AI oversight without stifling innovation. Delayed action risks fragmented standards, compliance uncertainty, and diminished public trust. The AI OSI Stack v4 offers a ready-made governance baseline that can be adopted immediately while leaving room for future advancement.

## Strategic National Initiatives
1. **Launch Governance Fire Drills:** Coordinate cross-agency simulations that use the OSI layers to test incident response, disclosure timing, and stakeholder communication for AI-enabled services.
2. **Adopt Open Governance Registry Pilots:** Establish registries where agencies and funded institutions publish AI system profiles, layer coverage, and governance attestations using the OSI schema.
3. **Harmonize Risk Disclosure:** Use the AI OSI Stack as a common taxonomy across CISA, SEC, FTC, and state regulators to align AI risk reporting and avoid duplicative compliance burdens.

## Partnership Value
- Demonstrates leadership by framing AI oversight as infrastructure, not a patchwork of policies.
- Enables rapid deployment of verifiable governance practices across public and private sectors.
- Sets the stage for future integration with proprietary AEIP transport protocols and Governance Control Tower services when national partners are ready for advanced interoperability.

## Call to Collaborate
Daniel P. Madden invites government and foundation partners to deploy the AI OSI Stack v4 in pilot programs, standards development, and capacity-building initiatives. Together we can establish a durable governance foundation that supports innovation while safeguarding civic trust.
