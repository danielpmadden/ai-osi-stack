# AI OSI Stack Briefing Kit v4
This kit introduces Daniel P. Madden’s AI OSI Stack — an open governance framework for board directors, regulators, and cybersecurity leaders. It translates AI system design into verifiable governance layers that map directly to existing regulatory expectations (NIST, ISO 42001, SEC disclosure rules). These materials demonstrate how the U.S. corporate and regulatory community can act now to implement verifiable AI governance without waiting for future federal frameworks. Proprietary transport protocols (AEIP) and Control Tower systems are excluded from this kit.
