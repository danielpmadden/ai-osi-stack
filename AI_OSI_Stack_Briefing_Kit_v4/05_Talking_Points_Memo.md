# Talking Points Memo: AI OSI Stack v4

- Think of the AI OSI Stack as the missing “reference model” for AI accountability — the equivalent of TCP/IP for trust and verification.
- The stack allows every AI asset to be cataloged, versioned, and governed using the same evidence chain the SEC already expects for financial and cybersecurity systems.
- U.S. enterprises and agencies can deploy this framework today with no new legislation; the challenge is coordination, documentation, and executive mandate.
- The open v4 materials establish the governance baseline. A future v5 roadmap extends into verifiable ledgers, interoperability infrastructure, and proprietary AEIP capabilities when organizations are ready for advanced integration.
- Directors and regulators gain a common language to assess material AI risk, while operators receive clear guidance on the artifacts and attestations required for launch.
- Positioning governance as infrastructure accelerates national readiness and bridges public-private collaboration on AI oversight.
