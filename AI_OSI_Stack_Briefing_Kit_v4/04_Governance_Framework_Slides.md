# AI OSI Stack v4 Governance Framework Slides

## Slide 1 – AI OSI Stack: Architecture as Accountability
- Position the stack as a unifying blueprint that links system design to oversight duties.
- Emphasize accountability artifacts at each layer and their relevance to fiduciary obligations.

## Slide 2 – Seven-Layer Overview with Standards Mapping
- Present the seven layers from Physical Substrate to Governance Publication.
- Map each layer to ISO 42001 domains and NIST AI RMF functions.
- Highlight how the layered model nests within enterprise risk management structures.

## Slide 3 – Board Fiduciary Lens: “AI Governance = Cyber Governance 2.0”
- Contrast traditional cybersecurity controls with emerging AI assurance needs.
- Illustrate how adopting the AI OSI Stack extends familiar governance practices to AI.

## Slide 4 – Director Readiness Checklist
- Confirm committee assignments by OSI layer.
- Require management to maintain evidence repositories for each layer.
- Schedule quarterly governance briefings using OSI-aligned dashboards.

## Slide 5 – Sample Governance Disclosure Statement
- Show template sections: system scope, layer coverage, control owners, assurance status.
- Include evidence indicators (reports, attestations, ledger entries) without revealing proprietary methods.

## Slide 6 – Risk-to-Control Mapping
- Trace risks from hardware supply chain through civic participation impacts.
- Align each risk with OSI layer controls and associated regulatory references.

## Slide 7 – Adaptive Governance Metrics
- Introduce key indicators: Trust Readiness (TR), Governance Control Score (GCS), Data Integrity (DI), Disclosure Confidence Rating (DCR).
- Explain how to operationalize metrics within enterprise GRC platforms.

## Slide 8 – From Blueprint to Infrastructure
- Summarize the path to future integration with proprietary AEIP transport protocols and Governance Control Tower services.
- Reinforce that today’s governance actions create readiness for advanced interoperability.

## Slide 9 – Optional Q&A / Discussion Prompts
- Suggested prompts: “Where do current controls map within the OSI layers?” “Which vendors can supply layer-level attestations?” “How will the board track governance metrics over time?”
