# Translating the AI OSI Stack v4 into Immediate Governance Action

## The AI OSI Seven-Layer Control Framework
The AI OSI Stack v4 organizes AI systems into seven verifiable layers, beginning with physical infrastructure and culminating in governance publication. Each layer contains control objectives, required artifacts, and evidence of accountability. The layered view allows technical teams and governance leaders to share a consistent taxonomy for risk identification, mitigation, and reporting.

1. **Layer 1 – Physical Substrate:** Hardware, facilities, and supply chain integrity.
2. **Layer 2 – Platform & Infrastructure:** Cloud services, operating systems, network protections.
3. **Layer 3 – Data Supply Chain:** Data sourcing, labeling, quality, and rights management.
4. **Layer 4 – Model Fabric:** Model selection, training, validation, and bias mitigation.
5. **Layer 5 – Application & Deployment:** Interfaces, APIs, safeguards, and monitoring.
6. **Layer 6 – Civic Interaction:** User governance, consent, redress, and participation.
7. **Layer 7 – Governance Publication:** Disclosure, audit, and institutional certification.

## Aligning with Existing Control Regimes
- **Layers 1–2:** Extend SEC cybersecurity disclosures, NIST CSF “Identify/Protect,” ISO 27001 controls, and FedRAMP baselines to explicitly cover AI compute assets, model pipelines, and supporting infrastructure.
- **Layers 3–5:** Integrate with model risk management, AI assurance programs, and MITRE ATLAS tactics. Require model lineage documentation, validation reports, and ongoing drift monitoring to satisfy supervisory expectations.
- **Layers 6–7:** Align with governance, audit, and disclosure processes. Embed AI OSI evidence into SOX, ESG, and regulatory reporting cycles to prove responsible release and oversight.

## Deliverables Leaders Can Request Today
- **Model Lineage Reports:** Structured records of training data, model versions, hyperparameters, and validation results across OSI Layers 3–5.
- **Governance Disclosure Statements:** Executive-ready summaries of AI system coverage by layer, including control owners, risk assessments, and remediation status.
- **Integrity Ledger Entries:** Hash-based or signature-backed attestations demonstrating immutable proof of key governance events without exposing proprietary IP.

## Operationalizing the Bridge
1. Establish cross-functional working groups mapped to each OSI layer.
2. Embed OSI layer checkpoints into existing change management, vendor onboarding, and third-party risk processes.
3. Integrate the OSI taxonomy into enterprise GRC platforms to enable automated reporting and executive dashboards.
4. Reserve advanced AEIP transport protocols and Control Tower orchestration as future enhancements once foundational governance is in place.

By adopting the AI OSI Stack v4 as a shared reference model, cybersecurity, compliance, and assurance leaders can convert technical controls into board-ready evidence and accelerate enterprise AI accountability.
