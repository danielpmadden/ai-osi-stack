# Cyber Risk Integration Brief: Operationalizing the AI OSI Stack v4

## Strategic Objective
Enable CISOs, Chief Risk Officers, and Audit Committees to integrate AI governance into existing cybersecurity and risk management programs without creating parallel processes.

## Layer-to-Framework Mapping
- **Layer 1 – Physical Substrate:** Align with NIST CSF “Identify/Protect,” ISO 27001 Annex A controls for physical security, and FedRAMP PE/MA families. Incorporate supply chain assessments for AI-specific hardware accelerators.
- **Layer 2 – Platform & Infrastructure:** Map to NIST CSF “Protect/Detect,” ISO 27001 A.12–A.13, and FedRAMP SC/SI controls. Ensure privileged access management, patching, and configuration baselines reflect AI workloads.
- **Layer 3 – Data Supply Chain:** Integrate with ISO 27001 A.8 (asset management), FedRAMP PL/RA controls, and MITRE ATLAS data poisoning scenarios. Require provenance tracking and contractual rights assurance.
- **Layer 4 – Model Fabric:** Connect to model risk management (MRM) policies, MITRE ATLAS model manipulation techniques, and NIST AI RMF “Measure/Manage.” Document training, validation, bias testing, and contingency plans.
- **Layer 5 – Application & Deployment:** Leverage NIST CSF “Detect/Respond,” ISO 27001 A.14, FedRAMP CA/IR controls, and DevSecOps guardrails. Implement runtime monitoring, rollback procedures, and human-in-the-loop thresholds.
- **Layer 6 – Civic Interaction:** Tie into privacy impact assessments, consent management, and incident response playbooks. Reference MITRE ATLAS social engineering scenarios to prepare for adversarial misuse.

## Operational Checklists
1. Require OSI-layer onboarding questionnaires for every AI vendor, model, or tool.
2. Embed OSI checkpoints into change management tickets, ensuring evidence artifacts are collected before production deployment.
3. Update risk registers to include OSI layer identifiers, enabling traceable mitigation tracking.
4. Align implementation maturity assessments (IMM) with OSI layers to benchmark progress against cyber risk roadmaps.

## Governance Perspective on AI Attack Surface
- **Data Lineage:** Establish tamper-evident logs of data sourcing, consent, and transformations.
- **Model Drift:** Use OSI Layer 4 controls to mandate periodic performance reviews and drift thresholds tied to business impact.
- **Disclosure Timing:** Synchronize Layer 7 governance publications with incident reporting and market disclosure obligations to avoid regulatory lag.

## Path to Advanced Capabilities
Adopting AI OSI Stack v4 creates a disciplined governance foundation. When organizations require real-time interoperability and advanced assurance, the proprietary AEIP transport protocols and Governance Control Tower services can extend these controls into automated, cross-enterprise coordination.
