# Policy Brief: Immediate Boardroom Actions with the AI OSI Stack v4

## Regulatory Context
The SEC’s 2024 cyber governance rule and evolving AI disclosure guidance emphasize that boards must maintain verifiable oversight of digital risk. Directors are expected to demonstrate that material AI exposures are identified, governed, and reported. Waiting for future statutory mandates risks regulatory censure, shareholder suits, and erosion of public trust.

## AI OSI Stack v4 Alignment
The AI OSI Stack v4 provides an actionable taxonomy for directors to classify and monitor AI risks. Each layer—from physical infrastructure through governance publication—corresponds to controls, evidence, and attestations that boards can request today. By adopting the stack, directors translate abstract AI discussions into concrete reporting requirements and oversight workflows.

## Board Actions to Implement Now
1. **Assign Oversight Using the OSI Taxonomy:** Designate board committees or directors to oversee specific OSI layers, ensuring coverage of physical assets, data governance, model risk, deployment safeguards, civic interaction, and public disclosure.
2. **Mandate Layered Internal Reporting:** Require management to deliver quarterly reports organized by OSI layers, detailing control performance, incidents, remediation plans, and residual risk.
3. **Integrate with SEC Disclosure:** Extend Form 10-K and 8-K narratives to describe AI Layer Coverage, including governance maturity and risk mitigation status, to meet evolving disclosure expectations.
4. **Require Pre-Launch Attestation:** Before any AI-enabled product reaches the market, mandate a Layer 7 “Governance Publication” attestation that confirms controls, audits, and stakeholder considerations have been satisfied.

## Outcome for Directors
Implementing these measures enables the board to demonstrate proactive duty of care, align with regulatory expectations, and prepare for future statutory requirements. The AI OSI Stack v4 empowers directors to document informed oversight before AI-specific regulations become binding, strengthening organizational resilience and public accountability.

Proprietary AEIP transport mechanisms and Governance Control Tower orchestration remain outside this public brief and can be introduced in subsequent engagements when advanced interoperability is required.
