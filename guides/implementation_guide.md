# Implementation Guide

## Purpose

This guide supports communities as they adopt the AI OSI Stack. It focuses on planning, facilitation, and documentation rather than software deployment.

## Preparation Steps

1. **Form a Stewardship Circle.** Assemble a diverse group of custodians representing policy, ethics, technology, and community perspectives.
2. **Review Foundational Materials.** Study the documents in [../foundation/](../foundation/) together, noting questions and local adaptations.
3. **Define Scope and Timeline.** Align expectations, resource availability, and review cycles with [../layers/civic_mandate.md](../layers/civic_mandate.md).

## Layer Activation Process

| Step | Action | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mandate Confirmation** | Complete L0 deliverables with public input. | Mandate summary, forum notes |
| **Ethical Chartering** | Draft and attest to L1 commitments. | Charter, training plans |
| **Data Readiness** | Inventory data and consent processes per L2. | Data inventory, risk narratives |
| **Model Planning** | Document L3 development approach. | Model cards, change logs |
| **Instruction Design** | Prepare prompts and oversight plans per L4. | Prompt catalogue |
| **Reasoning Exchange** | Establish interpretability practices per L5. | Dialogue logs |
| **Deployment Readiness** | Finalize integration plans per L6. | Deployment plan |
| **Publication Workflow** | Set reporting cadence per L7. | Publication calendar |
| **Participation Program** | Launch engagement strategy per L8. | Engagement plan |

## Adoption Tips

- Start with pilot projects that have clear civic benefits and measurable outcomes.
- Pair technical staff with community liaisons to ensure mutual understanding.
- Translate key documents into community languages and provide summaries for quick reference.
- Document lessons learned in the Transparency Record after each milestone.

## Sustaining the Stack

- Schedule semi-annual retrospectives to evaluate progress across all layers.
- Update the [../reference/roadmap.md](../reference/roadmap.md) with new priorities informed by participation feedback.
- Ensure leadership transitions include handover notes for each layer custodian.
