Update Plan 13 — “Federation & Policy Partnership Edition”

“Architecture becomes institution when it welcomes others.”

1 · Purpose

To open the AI OSI Stack v5 to structured collaboration with policymakers, standards bodies, and civil-society institutions — beginning with the European Union — while maintaining canonical control, rights protection, and semantic integrity.

2 · Objectives

Establish legitimate pathways for EU policy engagement and cooperative research.

Create a Federated Custodianship Framework allowing institutions to contribute without fragmenting the canonical stack.

Define a Policy Partnership Charter (PPC) compatible with EU AI Act Article 52, ISO 42001, and NIST RMF governance principles.

Preserve personal authorship while preparing for eventual institutional succession (“handing over the keys”).

3 · Federated Custodianship Framework

Normative additions (Layer 7 & Appendix I):

Federated Partner Definition —
Federated Custodian = an accredited public or academic body contributing to canonical maintenance under AEIP oversight.

Membership Criteria —
• Sign the Policy Partnership Charter.
• Maintain a Civic Charter (L0) and Custodial Self-Audit (L7).
• Agree to AEIP fidelity tests and Contextual Transparency Tier II disclosure.

Governance Contract —
Each partner SHALL publish a “Federated Contribution Record” (FCR) containing:
• scope of input (policy, technical, educational);
• timestamp & signature;
• canonical cross-hash link to v5 ledger.

Non-Fragmentation Clause —
Federated partners MAY extend layers locally but SHALL not redefine core clauses or license terms.

4 · Policy Partnership Charter (PPC)

A new normative artifact under /docs/Policy-Partnership-Charter.md

Sections:

Purpose & Scope — bridging AI OSI governance with public policy.

EU Alignment — explicit cross-reference to EU AI Act Recitals 9, 14, Annex IV, and Charter Arts 7–8.

Shared Values — dignity as constraint, Right-to-Opacity, Transparency ≠ Surveillance.

Engagement Mechanism — biannual joint review workshops and co-authored interpretive notes.

Succession Intent — acknowledging that the canonical author may delegate stewardship to a multi-institutional consortium upon ratification of v6.
