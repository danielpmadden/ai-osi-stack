# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the AI OSI Stack?

A civic framework that adapts the Open Systems Interconnection model to steward artificial intelligence with public accountability.

## Does this edition include software?

No. This civic edition contains human-readable Markdown guidance only. Communities may build tools separately, provided they remain open and non-proprietary.

## How does the Open Evidence Interface work?

It replaces closed APIs with shared documentation templates. Custodians publish evidence, decisions, and verification steps in accessible formats. See [../layers/reasoning_exchange.md](../layers/reasoning_exchange.md) for usage guidance.

## Who maintains the layers?

Layer custodians are appointed by the Stewardship Circle formed during implementation. They coordinate across layers and report through the Civic Oversight Interface.

## How often should the mandate be reviewed?

At least annually, and whenever significant community feedback or policy changes arise. Review cycles are defined in [../layers/civic_mandate.md](../layers/civic_mandate.md).

## What license applies?

This edition is intended for non-commercial use under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) license or equivalent community license. Confirm details in the [../README.md](../README.md).

## How are grievances addressed?

Through the participation mechanisms described in [../layers/civic_participation.md](../layers/civic_participation.md) and published via [../layers/governance_publication.md](../layers/governance_publication.md).

## Can we adapt the stack?

Yes. Adaptations SHALL remain non-commercial, document changes transparently, and maintain civic commitments outlined in [../foundation/03_Design_Principles.md](../foundation/03_Design_Principles.md).
