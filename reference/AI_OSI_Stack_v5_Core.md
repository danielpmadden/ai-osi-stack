# AI OSI Stack v5 – Constitutional Compass

## Layer L0 – Civic Mandate
- Defines the civic legitimacy anchor for AI operations.
- Establishes obligations for transparency, accountability, and participatory review.

## Layer L1 – Physical Compute Substrate
- Outlines infrastructure controls for secure, sustainable compute access.
- Specifies auditing requirements for data centers and energy disclosures.

## Layer L2 – Data Stewardship
- Governs sourcing, consent, lineage, and quality controls for datasets.
- Requires immutability records and civic oversight for sensitive corpora.

## Layer L3 – Model Development
- Details reproducibility, documentation, and safety gating for model training.
- Aligns with AEIP telemetry for monitoring and escalation signals.

## Layer L4 – Instruction Control
- Prescribes instruction red teaming, civic intent encoding, and escalation loops.
- Links to Persona Architecture safeguards for context-specific deployments.

## Layer L5 – Reasoning Exchange
- Describes protocols for deliberative reasoning, consensus tracking, and dissent capture.
- Integrates AEIP routing for civic verification signals and civic synthesizers.

## Layer L6 – Deployment Integration
- Enumerates release gates, rollback procedures, and service-level guardrails.
- Requires Semantic Version Control propagation across dependent civic services.

## Layer L7 – Governance Publication
- Specifies open publication cadence, translation guidance, and archival standards.
- Embeds provenance chains referencing the Integrity Ledger and Civic Charter.

## Layer L8 – Civic Participation
- Codifies participatory mechanisms, community ratification, and oversight forums.
- Interfaces with Civic Charter commitments and cross-jurisdictional reciprocity.

## AEIP Governance Spine
- Defines message headers, signatures, and routing tables for civic event flows.
- Synchronizes with AEIP Specification for schema compliance and multi-layer assurance.

## Semantic Version Control (SVC)
- Establishes major/minor/patch semantics triggered by changes in constitutional clauses.
- Requires downstream propagation to implementation guides and civic service registries.

## Persona Architecture
- Outlines role-based operating envelopes and consent-aware persona templates.
- Aligns persona obligations with L4 instruction controls and L5 reasoning protocols.

## Civic Integration Interfaces
- Provides reference touchpoints for municipal platforms, archives, and community tooling.
- Ensures integration retains open standard guarantees without embedding proprietary logic.
