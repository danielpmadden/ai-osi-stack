# Reference Directory Overview

`reference/` consolidates glossaries, mapping tables, and standards crosswalks that evidence compliance for each governance layer.

Navigation tips:
- Start with `index_of_clauses.md` to locate relevant obligations.
- Use mapping tables to align regulatory requirements with the stack's artefacts and verification methods.
- Maintain synchronization with `meta/v5-manifest.yaml` when updating canonical references.
