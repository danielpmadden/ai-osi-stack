# AI OSI Stack (Open Core)

The AI OSI Stack is an open civic governance framework for responsible AI stewardship. It adapts the classic networking OSI model into nine interdependent civic layers that help public institutions, community networks, and researchers document mandates, ethics, data practices, model development, operational deployment, and community participation. This repository provides the open-core documentation needed to adopt, localize, and iterate on the stack.

## Repository Structure

- `foundation/` – Core context, glossary, and design principles that describe the civic mandate behind the stack.
- `layers/` – Nine-layer civic feedback loop that defines responsibilities from mandate formation through participation.
- `guides/` – Implementation playbooks, testing frameworks, security practices, and ethics primers to adapt the layers.
- `reference/` – Roadmaps, comparative studies, FAQs, and index crosswalks that support ongoing stewardship.
- `.github/` and tooling configs – Community standards and automation defaults for collaboration.

## Getting Started

1. **Read the foundation.** Begin with `foundation/overview.md`, `foundation/context.md`, `foundation/glossary.md`, and `foundation/design_principles.md` to understand intent, terminology, and civic norms.
2. **Work through the layers.** Review each document in `layers/` to capture mandates, ethics, data care, model development, instruction controls, reasoning exchange, deployment integration, publication, and participation practices.
3. **Apply the guides.** Use `guides/implementation_guide.md`, `guides/testing_framework.md`, `guides/security_model.md`, and `guides/philosophy_ethics.md` to tailor the stack for your community.
4. **Consult the references.** Track milestones, answer common questions, and compare models using the resources in `reference/`.
