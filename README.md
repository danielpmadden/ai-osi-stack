AI OSI Stack v5
Version: v5.0.0
Purpose: Provide top-level orientation for the AI OSI Stack v5.
Status: Public reference (non-commercial)
---

## Transition Notice
v4 materials are archived; v5 introduces constitutional architecture and AEIP governance spine.

## Purpose
This README introduces the AI OSI Stack v5 canonical civic architecture, outlines repository contents, and provides guidance for civic partners, institutions, and researchers stewarding accountable AI governance.

## Scope
The scope covers the v5 directory structure, governance manifests, and version-control obligations. Operational implementations, including the Accountability Evidence Integration Platform (AEIP) runtime and Governance Control Tower, remain outside this standard and are referenced only as interfaces.

## Status
The repository is maintained as an open civic reference. Materials MAY be used with attribution under the stated license. Future drafts SHALL document updates through Governance Decision Records recorded in the Integrity Ledger.

## Key Points
- The Stack provides a layered constitutional model spanning civic mandate through civic participation (L0–L8).
- Documentation adopts standards-style language (MUST, SHALL, SHOULD) to clarify expectations without implying legal mandates.
- Design principles of Dignity, Integrity, and Stewardship guide every artefact and workflow.
