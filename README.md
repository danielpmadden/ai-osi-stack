Title: README.md
Version: v4.1-draft
Purpose: Provide top-level orientation for the AI OSI Stack v4 repository and reference architecture materials.
Status: Public reference (non-commercial)
---

## Purpose
This README introduces the AI OSI Stack v4 reference architecture, outlines repository contents, and provides guidance for institutional and public users seeking accountable AI governance resources.

## Scope
The scope covers the AI OSI Stack v4 directory structure, licensing context, and navigation cues. It applies to all open materials within this repository. Proprietary extensions, including the Accountability Evidence Integration Platform (AEIP) and Governance Control Tower, remain outside this release.

## Status
The repository is maintained as an open civic reference. Materials MAY be used with attribution under the stated license. Future drafts SHALL document any updates through Governance Decision Records noted in the audit log.

## Key Points
- The Stack provides a layered governance model spanning civic mandate through civic participation (L0–L8).
- Documentation adopts standards-style language (MUST, SHALL, SHOULD) to clarify expectations without implying legal mandates.
- Proprietary automation and advanced tooling will be described in forthcoming extensions separate from this public reference.
- Design principles of Dignity, Integrity, and Stewardship guide every artefact and workflow.

## Repository Layout
```text
AI_OSI_Stack_v4/   → Canonical Markdown artefacts for v4.1-draft
foundation/        → Background research and conceptual notes (legacy)
layers/            → Prior layer specifications (superseded)
reference/         → Crosswalks, provenance, and supporting materials
```

## What the AI OSI Stack Is
- A governance reference architecture for accountable AI.
- A civic-minded framework mapping ethical, technical, and fiduciary controls.
- Open, modular, and evidence-based; usable without external systems.

## What It Is Not
- Not a regulatory filing, compliance checklist, or legal instrument.
- Not affiliated with any government or corporate entity.
- Not a commercial service or live monitoring system.
- Proprietary extensions (AEIP / Governance Control Tower) are separate IP.

## Getting Started
1. Review [AI_OSI_Stack_v4/00_README.md](./AI_OSI_Stack_v4/00_README.md) for detailed orientation.
2. Consult [AI_OSI_Stack_v4/02_Architecture_Summary.md](./AI_OSI_Stack_v4/02_Architecture_Summary.md) and [AI_OSI_Stack_v4/03_Layer_Overview.md](./AI_OSI_Stack_v4/03_Layer_Overview.md) to understand layer responsibilities.
3. Use [AI_OSI_Stack_v4/06_Implementation_Guide.md](./AI_OSI_Stack_v4/06_Implementation_Guide.md) to plan adoption across institutional contexts.
