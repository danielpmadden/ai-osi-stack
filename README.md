## Purpose and Scope

The **AI OSI Stack** defines a complete architectural and governance framework for responsible artificial intelligence—modelled after the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) structure. Each layer in the Stack establishes where civic legitimacy, ethical authority, and technical accountability reside within an AI system.

Version 5 represents the **canonical custodial edition**, merging prior open versions into a single verifiable specification. It introduces a unified epistemic infrastructure (AEIP), expanded interpretive canon, and custodial integrity manifest, enabling transparent governance that is both testable and portable across jurisdictions.

> *The Stack transforms AI governance from paperwork into protocol—making every intelligent system intelligible to the society it serves.*

## Layered Architecture

| Layer | Name | Focus |
|-------|------|--------|
| 0 | **Civic Mandate** | Establishes social license and democratic authorization for AI use. |
| 1 | **Ethical Charter** | Encodes normative principles, rights, and oversight cycles. |
| 2 | **Data Stewardship** | Governs collection, consent, classification, and fiduciary handling. |
| 3 | **Model Lifecycle** | Documents training lineage, evaluation, and interpretability. |
| 4 | **Instruction & Control** | Manages prompts, roles, and operational guardrails. |
| 5 | **Reasoning Exchange** | Defines how model reasoning remains interpretable and contestable. |
| 6 | **Deployment & Integration** | Controls release, monitoring, rollback, and incident response. |
| 7 | **Governance Publication** | Translates internal evidence into public accountability artefacts. |
| 8 | **Civic Participation** | Enables community feedback, appeal, and renewal mechanisms. |

> Layers 0–8 form the operational Stack. Chapters 19A–24 extend governance to semantics, emotion, and culture (the *Interpretive and Applied Canon*).

## Custodianship and Integrity

This repository constitutes the canonical custodial edition of the AI OSI Stack. All prior public versions are considered non-authoritative. Integrity manifests and advisory checksums are recorded under `reference/provenance.yaml`.

Custodianship ensures that governance frameworks remain coherent, verifiable, and faithful to their civic intent.
