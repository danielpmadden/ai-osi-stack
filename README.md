## Overview

> **Jurisdiction-neutral / not legal advice.**  
> The Stack provides a civic-to-technical governance architecture and advisory pattern, it is not a substitute for legal counsel in any jurisdiction.

The **AI OSI Stack** is an open-standard, nine-layer framework for **governing artificial-intelligence systems** from **civic mandate** through **public accountability**. It defines a *governance spine* that binds policy, ethics, data, and engineering practice into verifiable evidence flows. Each layer produces machine-readable artefacts under the **AEIP (Accountable Evidence Interchange Protocol)** so oversight bodies can trace decisions in real time.

Version 4.0 is the **canonical edition**, audited for conceptual coherence, continuity, and civic intent.

## Layer Summary (0 – 8)

| Layer | Name | Purpose |
|-------|------|----------|
| 0 | **Civic Mandate** | Democratic authorization and renewal triggers |
| 1 | **Ethical Charter** | Enforceable duties, red lines, and review cycles |
| 2 | **Data Stewardship** | Provenance, consent, and fiduciary data handling |
| 3 | **Model Development** | Training integrity, evaluation, persona segregation |
| 4 | **Instruction & Control** | Prompt governance and intent management |
| 5 | **Reasoning Exchange** | AEIP execution, interpretability, and signatures |
| 6 | **Deployment & Integration** | Release, monitoring, incident response |
| 7 | **Governance Publication** | Evidence disclosure and civic transparency |
| 8 | **Civic Participation** | Community feedback and renewal mechanisms |

Additional interpretive chapters (19A–24) extend semantics, persona design, and therapy governance.

## Why It Matters

Modern AI evolves faster than governance can adapt.  

Most oversight remains siloed—model cards here, privacy reviews there, without a shared accountability backbone. The Stack replaces that fragmentation with a **layered, evidence-carrying protocol** that any organization can adopt, audit, and extend.

**Core Benefits**
- **Transparency with proof** — Every decision and artefact is AEIP-verifiable.  
- **Accountability without surveillance** — Auditability through registries, not tracking.  
- **Interoperability** — Aligned with ISO 42001, IEEE 7000, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act.  
- **Civic legitimacy** — Governance begins at Layer 0, not deployment.
