# AI OSI Stack — Civic Edition

## Purpose

The AI OSI Stack is a civic operating system for intelligence stewardship. This public-interest edition presents the stack as a fully human-readable framework with no proprietary code, monetized services, or cryptographic payloads. It is designed for governments, community organizations, educators, and researchers who seek transparent, accountable approaches to artificial intelligence.

## Repository Structure

```
ai-osi/
  00_FOUNDATION/
  10_LAYERS/
  20_GUIDES/
  30_REFERENCE/
README.md
```

- **00_FOUNDATION** introduces the stack's context, glossary, and design principles.
- **10_LAYERS** documents each of the nine civic layers, adapted from the OSI model.
- **20_GUIDES** offers implementation, testing, security, and philosophical guidance.
- **30_REFERENCE** provides comparative models, roadmap planning, FAQs, and a crosswalk index.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Begin with [ai-osi/00_FOUNDATION/00_Overview.md](ai-osi/00_FOUNDATION/00_Overview.md) to understand the civic feedback loop.
2. Work through the layer documents in [ai-osi/10_LAYERS/](ai-osi/10_LAYERS/) to establish mandates, ethics, data care, development, instruction, reasoning, deployment, publication, and participation practices.
3. Apply the guides in [ai-osi/20_GUIDES/](ai-osi/20_GUIDES/) to tailor processes, evaluate progress, and maintain security.
4. Reference [ai-osi/30_REFERENCE/](ai-osi/30_REFERENCE/) for context, planning, and quick answers.
