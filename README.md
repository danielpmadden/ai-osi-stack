# The AI OSI Stack: Version 4 (Expanded)

The AI OSI Stack: Version 4 (Expanded) is the official release of Daniel P. Madden's seven-layer architecture for transparent and accountable AI governance. The stack interlocks operational layers with the AI Governance Trinity—Persona Architecture, Epistemology by Design, and the Adaptive Ethical Implementation Protocol (AEIP)—to deliver cohesive oversight from strategic framing through lifecycle assurance.

## Purpose

This repository curates the authoritative reference implementation and documentation for Version 4 (Expanded) of The AI OSI Stack. It is designed to help practitioners, auditors, and policymakers align AI initiatives with the stack's layered controls, evidentiary rigor, and ethical guardrails.

## Scope

The materials provided here cover:

- Conceptual models for all seven layers of the stack and their governance dependencies.
- Reference processes, checklists, and patterns for Persona Architecture, Epistemology by Design, and AEIP integration.
- Version-tracked updates to the expanded release, including migration notes from earlier editions.
- Supporting artifacts used for formal assessments, audits, and assurance reporting.

## Current Canonical Documents

- `source/AI_OSI_Stack_v4_Test_Integrated.md` — Canonical governance specification for the AI OSI Stack v4 (Test Integration Draft). This document supersedes all prior stack versions in this repository.

### Historical References

- `source/AI_OSI_Stack_v4-TEST.pdf` — Previous draft retained for comparison only.
- `versions/AI_OSI_Stack_v1.pdf`, `versions/AI_OSI_Stack_v2.pdf`, `versions/AI_OSI_Stack_v3.pdf` — Historical releases provided for archival study and SHALL NOT be treated as normative guidance.

## Repository Structure

- `source/` – Primary specifications, canonical diagrams, and structured guidance for each layer.
- `docs/` – Supplementary narratives, practitioner briefs, and crosswalks to regulatory frameworks. See `docs/aeip-crosswalk-matrix.md` for AI OSI, Persona Architecture, and EbD mappings.
- `schemas/` – Machine-readable AEIP artifact definitions. Refer to `schemas/README.md` for usage guidance and workflow integration notes.
- `tests/` – Validation exemplars that demonstrate schema conformance and ledger linkage expectations.
- `versions/` – Archived materials from prior releases, maintained for traceability.
- `LICENSE.txt` – Licensing terms governing use and distribution.
- `INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md` – Repository-wide temporal integrity attestation awaiting governance signature.

## Usage Notes

- Clone the repository to retain the directory hierarchy required for cross-referencing layers and governance modules.
- Review `versions/` before upgrading implementations to understand deltas from earlier stacks.
- Apply the guidance in `source/` together with the AI Governance Trinity components to maintain coherence between design intent and operational controls. Reference the AEIP schemas and validation examples when instantiating governance artifacts to ensure interoperability and temporal integrity.
- Engage organizational security teams when adapting artifacts to production environments to ensure contextual compliance.

## Integrity and Verification

Release archives include checksums published alongside tagged releases. All commits for the Version 4 (Expanded) line are signed, and official release tags are issued only after integrity verification and governance review.
