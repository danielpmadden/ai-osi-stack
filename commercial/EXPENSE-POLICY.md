## Purpose
This Expense and Payment Policy applies to all AI OSI Stack engagements, including pilots, consulting, workshops, and advisory retainers. AI OSI Stack was conceived, authored, and maintained by Daniel P. Madden as an independent, self-funded project without institutional, corporate, or governmental backing.

## Standard Payment Terms
- **Invoices:** Issued upon contract execution (for upfront amounts) and upon delivery milestones.  
- **Schedule:** 50% upfront and 50% on delivery (Net 15). Tier 3 institutional clients: 60% upfront and 40% on delivery.  
- **Late Payment:** Interest of 1.5% per month (or the maximum allowed by law) may be applied to overdue balances. Consultant may pause services for non-payment.

## Reimbursable Expenses
- **Travel:** Commercial airfare (economy or client-approved class), rail, ground transportation, and mileage at IRS rates.  
- **Lodging:** Reasonable accommodations aligned with government per diem guidelines unless otherwise agreed.  
- **Per Diem and Meals:** Actuals or per diem rates as specified in the Statement of Work.  
- **Materials and Supplies:** Project-specific purchases approved in writing by the client.  
- **Third-Party Services:** Specialist fees or software subscriptions pre-approved by the client.

## Documentation and Submission
- Expenses require itemized receipts unless local practice prevents issuance.  
- Expense reports are submitted with monthly invoices or as otherwise agreed.  
- Currency conversions use the prevailing rate on the transaction date.

## Travel Day Billing
- Travel days dedicated to client work may be billed at fifty percent (50%) of the applicable daily rate, as specified in the Statement of Work.  
- Travel time used for consulting activities may be billed at the standard hourly rate.

## Non-Reimbursable Items
- Luxury travel upgrades without prior approval.  
- Alcoholic beverages, personal entertainment, or fines.  
- Equipment purchases not authorized in writing.  
- Expenses incurred outside the engagement scope.

## Ethical and Legal Compliance
- Expenses must comply with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and public-sector procurement rules.  
- Consultant and clients shall avoid conflicts of interest and maintain accurate records.  
- Deliverables and expenditures must not support surveillance, military, discriminatory, or unethical uses.

## Dispute Resolution
- Questions regarding expenses should be raised within ten (10) days of invoice receipt.  
- Disputes will be resolved through good-faith negotiation and, if necessary, mediation consistent with the Master Service Agreement.
