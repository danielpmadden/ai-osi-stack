## Engagement Philosophy
AI OSI Stack engagements scale to address civic, academic, enterprise, and institutional needs. Pricing reflects the complexity of multi-stakeholder governance, data sensitivity, and risk posture. AI OSI Stack was conceived, authored, and maintained by Daniel P. Madden as an independent, self-funded project. There is no institutional, corporate, or governmental backing.
