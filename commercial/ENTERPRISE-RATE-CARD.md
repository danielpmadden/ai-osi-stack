## Engagement Philosophy
AI OSI Stack engagements scale to address civic, academic, enterprise, and institutional needs. Pricing reflects the complexity of multi-stakeholder governance, data sensitivity, and risk posture. AI OSI Stack was conceived, authored, and maintained by Daniel P. Madden as an independent, self-funded project. There is no institutional, corporate, or governmental backing.

## Premium Pricing Structure

> The AI OSI Stack represents the world’s first open standard for accountable AI governance authored and maintained by Daniel P. Madden.  
> Pricing reflects the originality, strategic depth, and direct authorship of the canonical framework, as well as its unique alignment with emerging standards such as ISO 42001, IEEE 7000-series, NIST AI RMF, and the EU AI Act.  
> Engagements are premium because they integrate civic design, legal accountability, and technical architecture—a domain with extremely limited global expertise.
