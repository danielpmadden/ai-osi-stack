# Commercial Engagement Overview

Authorship & Provenance — The AI OSI Stack was conceived, authored, and maintained by Daniel P. Madden as an independent, self-funded project. There is no institutional, corporate, or governmental backing. Any references to organizations, domains, or future bodies are aspirational placeholders for a community that does not yet exist.

Large-language-model tools were used under author supervision; all final content reviewed and approved by Daniel P. Madden.

## Advisory Services
- Canonical gap assessments and AEIP implementation reviews.
- Customization workshops aligned with civic mandates and regulatory expectations.
- Dashboard, ledger, and AEIP automation configuration.

## Engagement Principles
- Not legal advice / jurisdiction-neutral. Work focuses on governance architecture.
- Advisory checksum workflows only; clients maintain their own provenance logs.
- Transparent scope, deliverables, and exit criteria for every engagement.
