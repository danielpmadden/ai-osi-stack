# Terms of Service (Draft)

1. **Scope.** Advisory services focus on governance architecture, AEIP configuration, and civic accountability workflows. No legal advice is provided.
2. **Authorship & Provenance.** The AI OSI Stack was conceived, authored, and maintained by Daniel P. Madden as an independent, self-funded project. There is no institutional, corporate, or governmental backing. Any references to organizations, domains, or future bodies are aspirational placeholders for a community that does not yet exist.
3. **AI Assistance Disclosure.** Large-language-model tools were used under author supervision; all final content reviewed and approved by Daniel P. Madden.
4. **Client Responsibilities.** Clients maintain their own checksum logs, regulatory interpretations, and deployment risk assessments.
5. **Confidentiality.** Shared materials remain confidential unless otherwise agreed. Synthetic examples are preferred for collaborative exercises.
6. **Payment & Scheduling.** Milestones, rates, and payment schedules are agreed in the statement of work.
7. **Attribution.** Public deliverables should credit the AI OSI Stack and maintain licensing information (CC BY-SA 4.0 documentation, Apache-2.0 code).
8. **Termination.** Either party may terminate with written notice; outstanding work will be billed to date.
