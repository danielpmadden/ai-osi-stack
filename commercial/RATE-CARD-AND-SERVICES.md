## Overview
AI OSI Stack was conceived, authored, and maintained by Daniel P. Madden as an independent, self-funded project. There is no institutional, corporate, or governmental backing. This rate card provides standard offerings for civic, academic, and enterprise collaborations. Custom Statements of Work (SOWs) will refine scope, deliverables, and pricing.

## Premium Professional Services

> The AI OSI Stack represents the world’s first open standard for accountable AI governance authored and maintained by Daniel P. Madden.  
> Pricing reflects the originality, strategic depth, and direct authorship of the canonical framework, as well as its unique alignment with emerging standards such as ISO 42001, IEEE 7000-series, NIST AI RMF, and the EU AI Act.  
> Engagements are premium because they integrate civic design, legal accountability, and technical architecture—a domain with extremely limited global expertise.
