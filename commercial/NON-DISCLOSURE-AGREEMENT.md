## 1. Parties
This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of **[Effective Date]** between **Daniel P. Madden** ("Party A") and **[Client Name]** ("Party B"), collectively the "Parties."

## 2. Purpose
The Parties wish to exchange certain confidential and proprietary information for the purpose of evaluating or conducting collaborative work involving AI OSI Stack pilots, consulting, advisory services, or related initiatives ("Permitted Purpose"). AI OSI Stack was conceived, authored, and maintained by Daniel P. Madden as an independent, self-funded project with no institutional, corporate, or governmental backing.

## 3. Definition of Confidential Information
"Confidential Information" means all non-public information disclosed by a Party to the other Party, whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or reasonably should be understood to be confidential. Confidential Information includes business plans, technical data, product roadmaps, pricing, financials, and personal data.

## 4. Obligations
4.1 The receiving Party shall:
- Use Confidential Information solely for the Permitted Purpose;
- Protect Confidential Information using at least reasonable care;
- Limit disclosure to employees, officers, directors, contractors, or advisors who have a need to know and are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those in this Agreement.
- Refrain from requesting or transmitting personally identifiable or confidential third-party data; all examples and artefacts shall remain synthetic.
4.2 The receiving Party shall not disclose Confidential Information to any third party without the disclosing Party's prior written consent.

## 5. Exclusions
Confidential Information does not include information that:  
(a) is or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement;  
(b) was known to the receiving Party prior to disclosure;  
(c) is independently developed by the receiving Party without use of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information; or  
(d) is obtained from a third party without breach of any obligation.

## 6. Compelled Disclosure
If the receiving Party is required by law, regulation, or court order to disclose Confidential Information, it shall promptly notify the disclosing Party (to the extent legally permitted) and cooperate in seeking protective measures. Only the legally required portion shall be disclosed.

## 13. Remedies
The Parties acknowledge that unauthorized disclosure may cause irreparable harm. The disclosing Party is entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to other remedies.

## 14. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, Daniel P. Madden's aggregate liability under this Agreement is limited to the fees (if any) actually paid by Party B in connection with the Permitted Purpose. Neither Party shall be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.

## 15. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the United States and the state of [Governing State], without regard to conflicts of laws principles. The Parties will attempt in good faith to resolve disputes through negotiation and, if necessary, confidential mediation seated in Daniel P. Madden's home jurisdiction of [City, State] prior to litigation. Venue lies in the state or federal courts of [County, State], consistent with the mediation outcome.
