## Purpose
This policy establishes the ethical and security standards for handling data within AI OSI Stack engagements. AI OSI Stack was conceived, authored, and maintained by Daniel P. Madden as an independent, self-funded project. There is no institutional, corporate, or governmental backing. The policy complements client governance protocols and applicable regulations.

## Guiding Principles
1. **Human-Centered Governance:** Prioritize human oversight, transparency, and accountability in all AI deployments.  
2. **Minimal Data Access:** Collect and process only the data necessary for agreed deliverables.  
3. **Equity and Non-Discrimination:** Reject use cases that reinforce bias or harm marginalized communities.  
4. **Ethical Use Restriction:** Prohibit adaptation of AI OSI Stack outputs for surveillance, military, discriminatory, or harmful purposes.  
5. **Open Collaboration:** Encourage civic participation and knowledge-sharing while honoring confidentiality obligations.

## Data Classification
- **Public:** Information intended for open publication.  
- **Internal:** Operational materials shared within project teams.  
- **Confidential:** Sensitive client data, regulated datasets, or personally identifiable information (PII).  
- **Restricted:** Highly sensitive data requiring additional safeguards, such as regulatory or legal constraints.

## Access Controls
- Implement role-based access, granting the minimum level necessary.  
- Use strong authentication (multi-factor when available) for remote access.  
- Revoke access promptly when no longer needed.

## Data Handling Requirements
- Store Confidential and Restricted data on encrypted systems.  
- Transmit sensitive data using secure channels (VPN, TLS).  
- Avoid storing personal data in unmanaged devices or consumer cloud services.  
- Maintain audit trails of data transfers and processing activities.

## Incident Response
- Report suspected data incidents to Daniel P. Madden and designated client contacts within 24 hours of discovery.  
- Document incident details, affected systems, and mitigation actions.  
- Cooperate with client-led investigations and regulatory notifications.

## Retention and Disposal
- Retain data only as long as required for the engagement or regulatory obligations.  
- Securely delete or return client-provided data within thirty (30) days of engagement closure unless otherwise agreed.  
- Document disposal actions for audit purposes.

## Third-Party Collaboration
- Conduct due diligence on subcontractors or partners accessing client data.  
- Require written agreements mirroring this policy's obligations.  
- Monitor compliance through periodic reviews or attestations.

## Transparency and Accountability
- Provide clients with documentation of data flows, governance decisions, and audit logs upon request.  
- Engage stakeholders in reviewing algorithmic impact assessments and governance artifacts.  
- Maintain records supporting compliance with applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, state privacy statutes).

## Training and Awareness
- Ensure all project contributors receive orientation on this policy and client-specific requirements.  
- Update training materials annually to reflect evolving standards and regulations.

## Policy Review
This policy is reviewed at least annually by Daniel P. Madden and updated as necessary to align with regulatory changes and community feedback.
