Version: v4.1-draft
Purpose: Provide implementation guidance for adopting the AI OSI Stack v4 across institutions.

## Purpose
This guide outlines recommended steps and controls for implementing the AI OSI Stack v4 within institutional environments, ensuring traceable governance outcomes.

## Scope
Guidance includes governance setup, artefact creation, assurance workflows, and continuous improvement practices across layers L0–L8. It excludes proprietary automation, which will be addressed in future releases.

## Status
Implementation practices are issued as normative recommendations. Institutions MAY adapt sequencing, but MUST preserve the integrity of artefacts and terminology.

## Key Points
- Implementation SHOULD begin with establishing the Institutional Trust Profile (ITP) and Civic Charter.
- Cross-functional teams MUST document Governance Decision Records (GDR) for each significant oversight action.
- Operational Assurance Matrices (OAM) SHOULD be used to track readiness, risk mitigations, and deployment approvals.
- Incident Learning Exchange (ILE) outputs MUST inform renewal and improvement cycles.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Initiate Civic Mandate (L0)**: Define purpose, scope, and fiduciary obligations. Create ITP and stakeholder register.
2. **Codify Ethical Charter (L1)**: Establish rights-based principles, oversight roles, and renewal cadence. Approve Dignity and Stewardship commitments.
3. **Establish Data Stewardship (L2)**: Map data sources, consent agreements, and fiduciary handling procedures. Document Data Fiduciary Matrix.
4. **Control Model Lifecycle (L3)**: Record training lineage, evaluation protocols, and interpretability measures within the Model Evidence File.
5. **Govern Instruction & Control (L4)**: Create prompt governance policies, role definitions, and guardrail catalogues.
6. **Maintain Reasoning Exchange (L5)**: Implement reasoning ledger and contestability pathways to ensure explainability.
7. **Prepare Deployment & Integration (L6)**: Develop OAM, monitoring plans, rollback triggers, and incident response playbooks.
8. **Publish Governance Evidence (L7)**: Assemble GDS for public transparency and fiduciary reporting.
9. **Sustain Civic Participation (L8)**: Operate feedback channels, appeals processes, and renewal decisions informed by ILE outputs.

## Continuous Improvement
- Conduct periodic maturity assessments using criteria in [07_Maturity_and_Metrics.md](./07_Maturity_and_Metrics.md).
- Document lessons learned and corrective actions within the GDR and ILE artefacts.
- Further automation and protocolization will be described in forthcoming proprietary extensions.
