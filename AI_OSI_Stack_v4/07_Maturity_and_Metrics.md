Title: 07_Maturity_and_Metrics.md
Version: v4.1-draft
Purpose: Define maturity levels and measurement indicators for AI OSI Stack v4 adoption.
Status: Public reference (non-commercial)
---

## Purpose
This document establishes maturity stages and metrics to evaluate institutional adoption of the AI OSI Stack v4 across governance, technical, and civic dimensions.

## Scope
Maturity criteria apply to all layers L0–L8 and associated artefacts. Indicators support self-assessment, peer review, and evidence reporting without implying regulatory compliance.

## Status
Metrics remain in draft for public review. Institutions SHOULD tailor measurement thresholds to context while preserving comparative meaning of each maturity stage.

## Key Points
- Maturity stages progress from Initiating to Embedded Stewardship.
- Indicators MUST align with Institutional Trust Profiles, Governance Decision Records, and Operational Assurance Matrices.
- Civic participation outcomes SHOULD be measured using feedback responsiveness and renewal cadence.

## Maturity Stages
| Stage | Description | Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Level 1 – Initiating | Foundational awareness of AI governance obligations. | Civic mandate drafted, key stakeholders identified, baseline terminology adopted. |
| Level 2 – Structured | Processes documented across L0–L4 with early evidence capture. | Ethical charter approved, data stewardship procedures defined, GDR initiated. |
| Level 3 – Integrated | Cross-layer workflows coordinated and evidenced. | OAM operational, reasoning exchange monitored, transparency planning underway. |
| Level 4 – Transparent | Governance evidence published and civic participation active. | GDS released, ILE functioning, feedback cycles informing policy updates. |
| Level 5 – Embedded Stewardship | Governance embedded across institutional strategy and culture. | Continuous improvement metrics tracked, stewardship commitments renewed, lessons integrated upstream. |

## Measurement Indicators
- **Legitimacy Metrics (L0–L1)**: Renewal cadence of civic charter, documented fiduciary responsibilities, adherence to dignity commitments.
- **Data & Model Metrics (L2–L3)**: Data quality scores, lineage completeness, interpretability confidence, incident response readiness.
- **Operational Metrics (L4–L6)**: Guardrail coverage, decision latency, OAM risk closure rates, change management adherence.
- **Transparency Metrics (L7)**: Frequency of GDS publication, accessibility of disclosures, independent review outcomes.
- **Participation Metrics (L8)**: Response time to appeals, integration of feedback actions, sustainability of community engagement.

## Continuous Review
Institutions SHOULD perform maturity assessments at least annually and MUST document resulting actions within GDR and ILE artefacts. Further automation and protocolization of metrics will be provided in proprietary extensions.
