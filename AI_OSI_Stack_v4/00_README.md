Title: 00_README.md
Version: v4.1-draft
Purpose: Provide orientation to the AI OSI Stack v4 reference architecture repository.
Status: Public reference (non-commercial)
---

## Purpose
The README establishes the intent, governance posture, and navigation cues for the AI OSI Stack v4 reference architecture. It ensures that institutional and public audiences can locate the canonical artefacts for accountable AI oversight.

## Scope
This document covers the overall repository structure, authoritative definitions of the Stack, and the expectations for using or extending the materials. It applies to all directories and Markdown files within `AI_OSI_Stack_v4`.

## Status
The AI OSI Stack v4.1-draft is maintained as an open civic reference. Materials MAY be used, studied, or adapted with attribution under the governing license. Proprietary automation, including the Accountability Evidence Integration Platform (AEIP) and Governance Control Tower, SHALL be developed separately and is not part of this release.

## Key Points
- The Stack is organized across layers L0–L8, with supporting guidance on governance principles, implementation, and assessment.
- All artefacts adopt standards-style language (MUST, SHALL, SHOULD) to describe governance expectations without implying legal mandates.
- Proprietary extensions, including AEIP and the Governance Control Tower, are referenced only as future work.
- Design principles of Dignity, Integrity, and Stewardship inform every layer and decision pathway.

## What the AI OSI Stack Is
- A governance reference architecture for accountable AI.
- A civic-minded framework mapping ethical, technical, and fiduciary controls.
- Open, modular, and evidence-based; usable without external systems.

## What It Is Not
- Not a regulatory filing, compliance checklist, or legal instrument.
- Not affiliated with any government or corporate entity.
- Not a commercial service or live monitoring system.
- Proprietary extensions (AEIP / Governance Control Tower) are separate IP.

## Usage Expectations
Institutions SHOULD adapt the Stack to match their oversight mandates while preserving traceability between civic intent, ethical guardrails, and technical operations. Any derivative work MUST respect attribution requirements and MUST NOT imply official endorsement.
