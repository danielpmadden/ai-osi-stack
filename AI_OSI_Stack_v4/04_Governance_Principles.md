Title: 04_Governance_Principles.md
Version: v4.1-draft
Purpose: Establish core governance principles and controls guiding the AI OSI Stack v4.
Status: Public reference (non-commercial)
---

## Purpose
This document codifies the foundational principles that SHALL govern deployment and oversight of AI systems within the AI OSI Stack v4 reference architecture.

## Scope
Principles apply across all layers and artefacts. They inform policy drafting, fiduciary review, technical implementation, and civic engagement activities.

## Status
Principles are considered normative guidance for v4.1-draft. Institutions MAY contextualize implementation but MUST retain the substantive intent of each principle. Proprietary automation will inherit these principles when specified in future extensions.

## Key Points
- Governance MUST uphold Dignity, Integrity, and Stewardship across lifecycle decisions.
- Accountability SHALL remain evidence-based, with transparent traceability across artefacts.
- Civic legitimacy and fiduciary responsibility SHOULD be continuously renewed through feedback mechanisms.
- Risk management MUST prioritize human rights, community welfare, and systemic resilience.

## Principles
### Dignity
AI systems SHALL protect the intrinsic worth of individuals and communities. Implementers MUST document how each layer safeguards rights, mitigates harms, and respects autonomy.

### Integrity
Governance processes MUST maintain factual accuracy, tamper resistance, and auditability. Artefacts SHALL record decision criteria, responsible roles, and verification results.

### Stewardship
Institutions SHOULD exercise prudent, long-term care over data, models, and societal impacts. This requires sustainable operations, balanced benefits, and transparent obligations to stakeholders.

### Accountability Evidence
Oversight teams MUST maintain Institutional Trust Profiles (ITP), Governance Decision Records (GDR), Governance Dossier Sets (GDS), and Operational Assurance Matrices (OAM) as evidence of responsible conduct.

### Participation and Redress
Civic participation channels SHALL remain open, documented, and responsive. Incident Learning Exchange (ILE) outputs SHOULD feed into renewal decisions and preventive controls.
