Title: 01_Executive_Brief.md
Version: v4.1-draft
Purpose: Summarize the AI OSI Stack v4 for institutional decision-makers and oversight leaders.
Status: Public reference (non-commercial)
---

## Purpose
This executive brief provides a concise narrative for institutional stewards, outlining how the AI OSI Stack v4 establishes accountable AI governance across policy, ethics, and engineering domains.

## Scope
The brief addresses intended audiences, the civic framing of the Stack, and the priority benefits of adopting the architecture. It SHALL be used to orient governing boards, fiduciary committees, and public oversight bodies.

## Status
The Stack remains an open standards-style reference. No endorsement from external institutions is implied. Proprietary automation, including AEIP and the Governance Control Tower, will be addressed in forthcoming extensions and is not part of the public release.

## Key Points
- The Stack aligns civic mandates, ethical obligations, and technical controls across layers L0–L8.
- Design principles of Dignity, Integrity, and Stewardship guide all controls and SHOULD be reflected in institutional policies.
- Institutions adopting the Stack MUST maintain transparent evidence chains to demonstrate oversight and fiduciary accountability.
- Further automation and protocolization will be described in forthcoming proprietary extensions.

## What the AI OSI Stack Is
- A governance reference architecture for accountable AI.
- A civic-minded framework mapping ethical, technical, and fiduciary controls.
- Open, modular, and evidence-based; usable without external systems.

## What It Is Not
- Not a regulatory filing, compliance checklist, or legal instrument.
- Not affiliated with any government or corporate entity.
- Not a commercial service or live monitoring system.
- Proprietary extensions (AEIP / Governance Control Tower) are separate IP.
