# AI OSI Stack Changelog — v5.1-open-core

**Release Date:** 2025-11-09  
**Prepared By:** Daniel P. Madden

## Summary

- Established explicit open-core / proprietary IP boundary documentation.  
- Published `LEGAL/IP-BOUNDARIES.md` and trademark notice clarifying civic vs. private assets.  
- Updated README, provenance, and NOTICE messaging to reflect Governance Control Tower™ segregation.  
- Hardened `.gitignore` to prevent private runtime directories from entering the open-core tree.  
- Generated `_staging/README_IP_BOUNDARY.md` for packaging and `_ip_review/REPO_AUDIT_IP_BOUNDARY.md` for custodial assurance.

## Context

This changelog records the repository hygiene pass executed prior to the canonical v5 governance lock. Proprietary runtimes (AEIP runtime, Governance Control Tower™, ledger engines, analytics dashboards) remain private pending commercialization and governance integrity review.
