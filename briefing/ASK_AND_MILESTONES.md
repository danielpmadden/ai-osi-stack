# Ask & Milestones — AI OSI Stack v5

**Canonical context:** [INVESTOR_OVERVIEW.md](INVESTOR_OVERVIEW.md), [MARKET_AND_USECASES.md](MARKET_AND_USECASES.md), [docs/VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md](../docs/VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md), [docs/governance-dashboard/control-tower-readme.md](../docs/governance-dashboard/control-tower-readme.md), [commercial/COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.md](../commercial/COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.md).

## Funding Request

- **Target Raise:** $3.5M pre-seed / pilot fund focused on institutional governance infrastructure.
- **Structure:** Equity or hybrid equity + strategic partnership that respects the custodial license and deferred-signing roadmap.

## Use of Funds

1. **Registry MVP (40%)** — Productize Verification API and canonical registry with managed hosting, audit logging, and self-service onboarding for regulated entities.
2. **Enterprise Pilot Program (35%)** — Deliver three flagship pilots (finance, healthcare, public sector) using Control Tower dashboards, AEIP manifests, and standards crosswalks.
3. **Federation Launch (15%)** — Stand up a multi-party governance federation with supervised ledger replication and cross-jurisdiction schema harmonization.
4. **Community & Compliance Operations (10%)** — Fund integrity audits, legal counsel, and educational materials to maintain canonical provenance.

## Milestone Timeline

| Quarter | Milestone | Detail |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Q1** | Product Foundations | Ship managed Verification API beta, finalize registry architecture, and complete security hardening pass ([docs/VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md](../docs/VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md)). |
| **Q2** | Pilot Deployments | Launch finance and healthcare pilots with full AEIP lifecycle coverage, Control Tower dashboards, and joint audit rehearsals. |
| **Q3** | Federation & Certification | Establish cross-organizational governance federation, initiate regulator sandbox, and publish certification rubric tied to canonical audits. |
| **Q4** | Sealing & Scale | Execute deferred-signing ceremony, expand dashboard SaaS offering, and onboard public sector partners with disclosure portals. |

## Strategic Support Needed

- **Design & Visualization:** Transform placeholder diagrams (see [PRODUCT_ONEPAGER.md](PRODUCT_ONEPAGER.md)) into production-ready visuals for executive and regulatory decks.
- **Pricing & Packaging:** Refine tiered pricing and subscription packaging in concert with advisory partners ([commercial/COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.md](../commercial/COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.md)).
- **Regulatory Engagements:** Coordinate with EU, US, and ISO working groups to align canonical artefacts with certification pathways ([docs/LEGAL-AND-POLICY-BRIEF.md](../docs/LEGAL-AND-POLICY-BRIEF.md)).

The ask positions AI OSI Stack v5 to evolve from canonical blueprint to managed infrastructure powering verifiable AI governance across regulated industries.
