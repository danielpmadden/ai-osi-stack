# Team & Background — AI OSI Stack v5

## Author Bio

**Daniel P. Madden** is an independent governance architect with a humanities foundation in rhetoric, ethics, and civic design who transitioned into AI governance infrastructure. His work fuses narrative clarity with regulatory rigor, translating civic mandates and ethical commitments into operational controls that pass legal, audit, and policy review ([README](../README.md), [docs/LEGAL-AND-POLICY-BRIEF.md](../docs/LEGAL-AND-POLICY-BRIEF.md)).

## Origin Story

The AI OSI Stack began as a response to fragmented AI ethics programs that lacked verifiable evidence. Drawing on humanities scholarship and policy work, Madden built a layered blueprint—mirroring the Internet’s OSI model—to turn normative commitments into machine-verifiable artefacts. Iterations through v5 consolidated interpretive canon chapters, AEIP schemas, and dashboard scaffolding into a single accountability backbone ([README](../README.md), [docs/aeip-spec-v1-3.md](../docs/aeip-spec-v1-3.md), [docs/governance-dashboard/control-tower-readme.md](../docs/governance-dashboard/control-tower-readme.md)).

## Current Collaborators & Advisors

- **Custodial Roster (Advisory Roles):** Synthetic stewardship roster used in demonstrations features roles such as Data Steward (Riley Chen), Model Owner (Jordan Singh), and AEIP Guardian (Priya Das) to illustrate governance handoffs ([docs/custodian-roster.md](../docs/custodian-roster.md)).
- **Independent Networks:** Engagements draw on a network of legal, policy, and civic technologists engaged through workshops, audits, and standards dialogues; all contributions remain under Daniel P. Madden’s custodial authorship ([audits/200-repo-wide-integrity-report.md](../audits/200-repo-wide-integrity-report.md)).

## Operating Principles

1. **Independence:** Self-funded stewardship preserves mission fidelity and rapid iteration while keeping licensing custodial.
2. **Evidence-First:** Every concept is anchored to AEIP artefacts, integrity notices, and audit trails to maintain verifiability.
3. **Civic Alignment:** The stack privileges human dignity, consent-aware transparency, and public-interest outcomes across all deployments.

Use this background to brief stakeholders on the author’s unique humanities-to-governance trajectory and the disciplined custodial posture behind AI OSI Stack v5.
