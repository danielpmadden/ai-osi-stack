# Investor Overview — AI OSI Stack v5

**Canonical context:** AI OSI Stack v5 (canonical version v5.0-rc, 2025-11-09). Authored and stewarded by Daniel P. Madden. Reference [README](../README.md), [docs/LEGAL-AND-POLICY-BRIEF.md](../docs/LEGAL-AND-POLICY-BRIEF.md), and [audits/200-repo-wide-integrity-report.md](../audits/200-repo-wide-integrity-report.md) for technical, legal, and audit depth.

## Market Problem

- **Regulatory convergence:** EU AI Act imposes Annex IV documentation and post-market monitoring; ISO/IEC 42001 formalizes AI management systems; NIST AI RMF requires continuous Govern/Map/Measure/Manage cycles ([README](../README.md), [docs/standards-alignment-brief.md](../docs/standards-alignment-brief.md)).
- **Evidence gap:** Enterprises cannot prove compliance without verifiable artefacts. Current governance software lacks canonical schemas, deferred-signing policy, and civic mandate integration.
- **Trust deficit:** Boards, CISOs, and regulators demand provenance-backed AI disclosures to avoid enforcement actions and reputational damage ([INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md](../INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md)).

## Opportunity

- **Regulatory tailwinds:**
  - EU AI Act (Article 54, Annex IV) requires registered technical documentation for high-risk AI—addressable market across regulated sectors.
  - ISO/IEC 42001 §8.2-8.4 mandates governance controls and auditable records that align with AEIP artefacts.
  - NIST AI RMF (Govern & Manage functions) recommends traceable evidence loops, which the Stack operationalizes through AEIP validation workflows ([docs/VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md](../docs/VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md)).
- **Market pull:** Enterprises in finance, healthcare, and public sector need turnkey governance registries; regulators seek standardized audit packages; venture portfolios need defensible governance posture during diligence.

## Business Model

- **Verification API:** Subscription access to AEIP validation endpoints and provenance checks built atop the `govspine/` runtime and integrity workflows.
- **Registry Services:** Hosted canonical registry for governance manifests, custodial roles, and ledger receipts referencing [INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md](../INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md) policies.
- **Dashboard SaaS:** Managed “Control Tower” dashboard delivering manifest crosswalks, audit telemetry, and persona governance analytics ([docs/governance-dashboard/control-tower-readme.md](../docs/governance-dashboard/control-tower-readme.md)).
- **Advisory & Certification:** Premium engagements and canonical certification rights outlined in [commercial/COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.md](../commercial/COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.md).

## Defensibility

- **Canonical provenance:** AI OSI Stack is the audited open-standard with locked authorship, canonical versioning, and deferred-signing guardrails ([CANONICAL_PROVENANCE.yaml](../CANONICAL_PROVENANCE.yaml), [audits/200-repo-wide-integrity-report.md](../audits/200-repo-wide-integrity-report.md)).
- **Schema moat:** AEIP v1.3 schemas and interpretive canon define the evidence grammar regulators can adopt without rewriting controls ([docs/aeip-spec-v1-3.md](../docs/aeip-spec-v1-3.md)).
- **Ethical license:** “Open Standard / Custodial License” (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) preserves stewardship while allowing read-only reference; derivative commercial offerings require author participation ([LICENSE](../LICENSE), [GOVERNANCE_AND_LEGAL.md](GOVERNANCE_AND_LEGAL.md)).
- **Audit trail:** Repository-wide integrity audits document compliance posture and roadmap, creating trust with regulators and institutional clients ([audits/200-repo-wide-integrity-report.md](../audits/200-repo-wide-integrity-report.md)).

## Monetization Layers & Pricing Signals

1. **Verification API** — Tiered usage-based pricing tied to AEIP payload volume, bundling deferred-signing validations and ledger checks.
2. **Governance Registry** — Annual subscription per regulated entity with custodial notarization and disclosure services.
3. **Dashboard SaaS** — Seat-based pricing for compliance teams; includes risk metrics and manifest crosswalk exports.
4. **Advisory & Certification** — Premium retainers and pilot fees ($25K–$120K) from [commercial/COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.md](../commercial/COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.md).

**ROI Benchmark:** *Every $1M in governance spend prevents $10M in regulatory exposure.* This reflects fines, remediation costs, and lost contracts avoided through verifiable compliance.

## Traction & Proof Points

- Canonical documentation and audit reports already in circulation with legal and policy audiences ([docs/LEGAL-AND-POLICY-BRIEF.md](../docs/LEGAL-AND-POLICY-BRIEF.md)).
- Open-source runtime and dashboard scaffolding provide immediate technical integration pathways ([README](../README.md), [docs/governance-dashboard/control-tower-readme.md](../docs/governance-dashboard/control-tower-readme.md)).
- Integrity notice and verification guide establish trust with CISOs and regulators for future signing ceremonies ([INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md](../INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md), [docs/VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md](../docs/VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md)).

## Investment Thesis

Capital accelerates three vectors:

1. **Productization:** Harden Verification API, registry, and dashboard into managed offerings with enterprise-grade SLAs.
2. **Certification Pipeline:** Fund independent audits, signature ceremonies, and third-party attestations to institutionalize the standard.
3. **Market Activation:** Launch vertical-specific pilots (finance, healthcare, public sector) that showcase compliance ROI and create reference customers.

The AI OSI Stack is positioned as the accountability backbone for AI operations. Investment unlocks the infrastructure and distribution required to make canonical governance evidence ubiquitous across regulated AI deployments.
