# Market & Use Cases — AI OSI Stack v5

**Canonical source references:** [README](../README.md), [docs/LEGAL-AND-POLICY-BRIEF.md](../docs/LEGAL-AND-POLICY-BRIEF.md), [docs/governance-dashboard/control-tower-readme.md](../docs/governance-dashboard/control-tower-readme.md), [audits/200-repo-wide-integrity-report.md](../audits/200-repo-wide-integrity-report.md), [commercial/COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.md](../commercial/COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.md).

## Priority Use Cases

### Enterprise Governance

- **Audit-Ready AI Programs:** Instrument critical AI services with AEIP manifests and Control Tower dashboards to supply Annex IV evidence on demand.
- **Model & Persona Lifecycle Control:** Use persona architecture and instruction layer controls to align customer-facing AI agents with risk policies and refusal logic.
- **Integrated Compliance Reporting:** Automate crosswalks from AEIP artefacts to ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF, and internal assurance committees for board reporting.

### Regulator & Oversight Adoption

- **Certification Support:** Provide regulators with canonical schemas and integrity workflows so they can evaluate submissions consistently and request ledger proofs.
- **Supervisory Dashboards:** Deploy the Control Tower as a supervisory portal for ongoing monitoring of high-risk AI registrants.
- **Evidence Preservation:** Utilize deferred-signing policies to maintain chain-of-custody for contested decisions while respecting civic mandates and data ethics ([INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md](../INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md), [DATA-ETHICS.md](../DATA-ETHICS.md)).

## Vertical Focus Areas

1. **Finance:** Trading surveillance, credit adjudication, and AML decisioning require auditable reasoning traces and deferred-signing safeguards.
2. **Healthcare:** Clinical decision support, diagnostics, and patient communication agents demand persona controls, consent records, and interpretability scaffolding.
3. **Public Sector:** Licensing, benefits administration, and public safety analytics need civic mandate alignment, transparency portals, and multi-agency governance registries.

## Pilot Opportunities & Partners

- **Pre-Seed & Pilot Funds:** Partner with mission-aligned investors to finance Verification API hardening and regulator onboarding programs ([INVESTOR_OVERVIEW.md](INVESTOR_OVERVIEW.md)).
- **Enterprise Champions:** Identify regulated banks, health systems, or agencies to run 90-day AEIP pilots leveraging the Control Tower scaffold and governance spine runtime.
- **Regulatory Sandboxes:** Collaborate with innovation offices or supervisory authorities to test deferred signing, ledger validation, and disclosure workflows using canonical artefacts.
- **Academic & Civic Labs:** Engage universities and civic tech organizations to co-develop curriculum and participatory oversight modules derived from interpretive canon chapters ([docs/LEGAL-AND-POLICY-BRIEF.md](../docs/LEGAL-AND-POLICY-BRIEF.md)).

## Execution Enablers

- Published audits and verification guides give stakeholders confidence in provenance and readiness ([audits/200-repo-wide-integrity-report.md](../audits/200-repo-wide-integrity-report.md), [docs/VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md](../docs/VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md)).
- Commercial documents outline premium advisory and certification models for institutional rollouts ([commercial/COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.md](../commercial/COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.md)).
- Governance and security policies provide clear custodial rights, data ethics posture, and deferred-signing expectations ([SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md), [DATA-ETHICS.md](../DATA-ETHICS.md)).

AI OSI Stack v5 anchors these use cases with a canonical, evidence-first architecture so enterprises and regulators can mature AI accountability without reinventing governance infrastructure.
