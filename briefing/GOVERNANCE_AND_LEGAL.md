# Governance & Legal Brief — AI OSI Stack v5

**Canonical references:** [INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md](../INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md), [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md), [LICENSE](../LICENSE), [DISCLAIMER.md](../DISCLAIMER.md), [DATA-ETHICS.md](../DATA-ETHICS.md), [audits/200-repo-wide-integrity-report.md](../audits/200-repo-wide-integrity-report.md).

## Ethics & Custodial Stance

AI OSI Stack is authored and stewarded independently by Daniel P. Madden. The framework exists to embed dignity-first, civic-aligned governance into AI infrastructures; all examples are synthetic and jurisdiction-neutral ([README](../README.md), [DATA-ETHICS.md](../DATA-ETHICS.md)). The ethics posture enforces the clause “Transparency must never become surveillance” (AEIP v1.3) and prohibits adaptation for discriminatory, weaponized, or surveillance purposes ([docs/aeip-spec-v1-3.md](../docs/aeip-spec-v1-3.md), [commercial/COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.md](../commercial/COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.md)).

## Custodial Rights & Licensing

- **Model:** “Open Standard / Custodial License” — documentation under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0; code under Apache-2.0. Redistribution requires attribution and prohibits derivatives without explicit custodial approval ([LICENSE](../LICENSE), [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md)).
- **Canon Stewardship:** Canonical provenance is locked to the repository of record and domain listed in [CANONICAL_PROVENANCE.yaml](../CANONICAL_PROVENANCE.yaml). Mirrors are informational only and cannot claim canonical status without signed delegation ([INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md](../INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md)).
- **Engagement Terms:** Commercial use follows premium advisory, certification, and registry agreements described in [commercial/COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.md](../commercial/COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.md) and related legal templates.

## Deferred Signing Policy

Signatures and SHA-512 hashes for v5 artefacts publish once the sealing ceremony completes. Until then, governance teams must:

1. Reference [INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md](../INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md) for advisory hashes, signing workflow, and OpenTimestamps guidance.
2. Run verification steps from [docs/VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md](../docs/VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md) and `ops/release/verify.sh` once signatures are released.
3. Document local verification in governance ledgers to maintain chain-of-custody.

This deferred model preserves custodial control while allowing external auditors to rehearse validation procedures.

## Liability & Alignment Statements

- **Disclaimer:** The stack is not legal advice; institutions remain responsible for compliance in their jurisdictions ([DISCLAIMER.md](../DISCLAIMER.md)).
- **Liability:** Maintainer disclaims responsibility for derivative uses; security researchers and implementers must act in good faith ([SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md)).
- **Alignment:** Governance briefings, integrity notices, and audits reinforce consistent language across documentation, ensuring regulators encounter the same canonical statements in every channel ([audits/200-repo-wide-integrity-report.md](../audits/200-repo-wide-integrity-report.md)).
