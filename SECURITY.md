# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
- Email **security@aiosi.org** with the subject `AI OSI Stack Security Disclosure`.
- Include reproduction details, potential impact across AEIP layers, and any mitigation you recommend.
- If encrypted communication is required, request the current PGP fingerprint in your initial message.

The maintainer acknowledges reports within three business days and coordinates remediation timelines transparently with the reporter. Community impact assessments prioritize civic safety and public accountability.

## Advisory Integrity Workflow
- Follow `meta/INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md` for checksum logging guidance. The repository does not ship authoritative signatures.
- Store your checksum log with retrieved artifacts and note the commit hash referenced during review.
- Share advisory findings via issues or emails so they can be catalogued in Appendix P updates.

## Scope
This policy covers all source code (Apache-2.0) and documentation assets (CC BY-SA 4.0) in the repository. Examples and datasets are synthetic and designed to avoid personal data exposure.

## Responsible Disclosure Expectations
- Do not exploit or publicize vulnerabilities before coordination.
- Avoid introducing third-party data into issues or pull requests.
- Provide safe repro scripts or sanitized logs when possible.

Thank you for supporting the civic security of the AI OSI Stack.
