# Security Principles

AI OSI Stack v5 treats security as governance infrastructure rather than a perimeter feature. All security controls map to normative layers and are verifiable through the AI Epistemic Infrastructure Protocol (AEIP).

- Integrity First — Every release, ledger entry, and artifact is cryptographically signed (SHA-512 + GPG).

- Transparency with Consent — Disclosure is proportionate and privacy-preserving (“Transparency must never become surveillance”).

- Custodianship over Ownership — Maintainers act as trustees of the public record.

- Right-to-Opacity and Human Dignity remain non-revocable interpretive principles.
