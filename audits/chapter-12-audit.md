# Chapter 12 — AEIP Framework and Operations Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Demonstrates how AEIP artefacts satisfy ISO/IEC 42001 evidence management requirements.
- Enterprise lens: Provides concrete lifecycle checkpoints that streamline programme management offices.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Reinforces provenance logging, reducing disputes about missing audit trails.

## Gaps
- Policy: Should mention data residency considerations when synchronising AEIP stores across jurisdictions.
- Enterprise: Needs roadmap for scaling AEIP operations as system portfolios grow.
- Legal/Ethical: Could clarify how external auditors access AEIP records without compromising confidentiality.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- Add guidance on versioning AEIP templates when schemas are updated.
- Clarify which authority approves cross-layer linkage validations.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Reference 	exttt{appendix-i-audit-readiness} when discussing external review preparation.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- Why AEIP is the backbone for evidence sharing.
- How teams know a project has completed every required checkpoint.
