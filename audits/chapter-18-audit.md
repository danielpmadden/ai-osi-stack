# Chapter 18 — Interpretive and Temporal Continuity Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Preserves interpretive history in line with transparency obligations for long-lived systems.
- Enterprise lens: Helps new teams rapidly understand legacy decisions through structured trace artefacts.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Maintains accountability for enduring clauses, reducing risk of unnoticed regressions.

## Gaps
- Policy: Should address public access policies for interpretive archives.
- Enterprise: Needs tooling recommendations for synchronising continuity dossiers across repositories.
- Legal/Ethical: Could specify retention rules for individuals’ contributions to interpretive records.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- Clarify how semantic registry alerts are communicated to stakeholders.
- Add note on reconciling conflicting historical ledgers.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Reference 	exttt{appendix-h-integrity-controls} when discussing ledger stewardship.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- Why documenting context across decades matters.
- How to request clarification on past governance choices.
