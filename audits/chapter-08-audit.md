# Chapter 08 — Layer 5 Reasoning Exchange Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Enforces transparent deliberation consistent with OECD requirements for explainability.
- Enterprise lens: Provides structure for documenting collaborative reasoning, aiding cross-team accountability.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Captures discourse evidence useful for resolving claims of manipulation or exclusion.

## Gaps
- Policy: Needs mention of accessibility standards for published reasoning summaries.
- Enterprise: Could highlight collaboration tooling expectations for storing exchange artefacts.
- Legal/Ethical: Should acknowledge rights of participants to redact personal data from exchanges.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses

- Add note on handling reasoning chains that cross national legal regimes.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Reference 	exttt{appendix-g-participation-procedures} when describing public dialogue loops.
