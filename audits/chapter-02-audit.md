# Chapter 02 — Philosophical Foundations Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Maps philosophical commitments to semantic registry obligations, reinforcing EU AI Act requirements for documented design intent.
- Enterprise lens: Provides actionable pointers for governance councils to operationalise value alignment processes.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Highlights documentation of contested judgments, supporting defensible authorship narratives.

## Gaps
- Policy: Could further relate ethical anchors to specific ISO/IEC 42001 objectives on stakeholder involvement.
- Enterprise: Missing cost guidance for maintaining semantic stewards across multilingual deployments.
- Legal/Ethical: Needs explicit mention of data subject rights when philosophical disputes impact consent models.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- Add reminder that philosophical updates trigger AEIP change logs to prevent silent drift.
- Clarify escalation path when oversight memos conflict with baseline principles.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Link to 	exttt{appendix-d-glossary-and-terminology} when discussing terminology harmonisation.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- How value debates become auditable records.
- Ways communities can propose new guiding principles.
