# Chapter 16 — Strategic Resilience and Risk Mitigation Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Aligns resilience logging with regulatory expectations for continuous risk monitoring.
- Enterprise lens: Gives concrete artefacts for scenario planning and crisis rehearsal.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Documents remediation triggers, protecting affected parties during disruptions.

## Gaps
- Policy: Should coordinate with national emergency response frameworks when defining triggers.
- Enterprise: Lacks metrics for evaluating effectiveness of resilience drills.
- Legal/Ethical: Could specify obligations to notify impacted communities when resilience thresholds are breached.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- Clarify who validates integrity ledger updates after exercises.
- Add instructions on integrating lessons learned into AEIP artefacts.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Reference 	exttt{appendix-b-remediation-protocols} when describing recovery actions.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- What resilience evidence the public can inspect.
- How lessons from crises feed back into the Stack.
