# Integrity Recap

- Recomputed SHA-512 digests for all files changed during this audit using `sha512sum`.
- Appended the hashes to `INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md` under an Editorial Coherence Update with the statement "No version change; editorial coherence adjustments only."
- Integrity tooling was not rerun beyond hash verification; runtime signatures remain as previously recorded.
