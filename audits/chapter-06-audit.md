# Chapter 06 — Layer 3 Model Development Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Aligns model card governance with EU AI Act documentation duties and ISO/IEC 42001 risk controls.
- Enterprise lens: Encourages reuse of templates to reduce engineering overhead and speed reviews.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Connects design decisions to rationale records, improving liability defensibility.

## Gaps
- Policy: Could clarify how third-party models inherit AEIP evidence requirements.
- Enterprise: Needs detail on budgetary impact of maintaining historical model versions.
- Legal/Ethical: Should note how intellectual property boundaries interact with disclosure obligations.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- Add directive on when to trigger independent review before exiting sandbox testing.
- Spell out retention period for decision rationale records.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Refer to 	exttt{appendix-c-testing-protocols} for deeper validation requirements.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- What a model card must contain for civic oversight.
- How teams record why a design trade-off was accepted.
