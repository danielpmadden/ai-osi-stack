# Chapter 01 — Historical and Technical Lineage Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Establishes continuity narrative that supports OECD AI Principle on transparency of lifecycle decisions.
- Enterprise lens: Highlights reuse of interpretive trace artefacts, reducing onboarding cost for new programme managers.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Emphasises provenance preservation to defend against liability claims about sudden obligation shifts.

## Gaps
- Policy: Needs clearer linkage to national archival mandates when referencing integrity ledger obligations.
- Enterprise: Does not quantify resourcing needed to maintain longitudinal interpretive packets.
- Legal/Ethical: Could address how rights of contributors are maintained when migrating history into new platforms.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- Add subsection note on how often lineage packets are reviewed for completeness.
- Recommend listing responsible custodial roles for integrity ledger upkeep.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Insert pointer to 	exttt{appendix-h-integrity-controls} when describing ledger attestation.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- What documents show citizens how the Stack evolved.
- How to challenge a missing historical obligation.
