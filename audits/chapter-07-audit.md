# Chapter 07 — Layer 4 Instruction and Control Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Establishes auditable instruction logs, reinforcing controls envisioned by the EU AI Act for high-risk systems.
- Enterprise lens: Gives operations teams concrete artefacts for resolving prompt-related incidents quickly.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Preserves dialogue context to protect both users and operators during investigations.

## Gaps
- Policy: Should reference cross-border data concerns when instruction logs capture personal information.
- Enterprise: Needs guidance on segregation of duties for instruction reviewers versus system owners.
- Legal/Ethical: Could mention safeguards for whistle-blowers documenting improper instructions.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- Outline timeframes for producing interpretive trace artefacts after a contested session.
- Clarify escalation path when oversight memos recommend disabling instruction channels.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Add reference to 	exttt{appendix-e-privacy-and-safety} in sections discussing sensitive dialogue capture.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- Why prompts are treated like governance records.
- How communities can audit controversial instructions.
