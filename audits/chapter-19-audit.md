## Strengths
- Policy lens: Reinforces amendment governance consistent with constitutional transparency expectations.
- Enterprise lens: Provides clear triggers for refreshing AEIP commitments after constitutional updates.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Protects provenance of amendments through integrity-ledger references.

## Gaps
- Policy: Should mention civic ratification mechanisms when major changes occur.
- Enterprise: Needs communication plan for notifying operational teams of constitutional updates.
- Legal/Ethical: Could outline dispute resolution when stakeholders contest amendment legitimacy.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses

- Add instruction on archiving superseded constitutional text.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Include pointer to 	exttt{appendix-g-participation-procedures} for amendment consultation workflows.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- How residents know the Stack has changed.
