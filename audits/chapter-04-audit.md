# Chapter 04 — Layer 1 Ethical Charter Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Aligns charter maintenance with ISO/IEC 42001 governance expectations for value management.
- Enterprise lens: Specifies reuse of CCM templates, reducing duplication in compliance tooling.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Commits to semantic consistency that protects against ambiguous obligation statements.

## Gaps
- Policy: Could add requirement to consult labour councils when charters affect workforce obligations.
- Enterprise: Missing metrics for evaluating how charter updates impact training programmes.
- Legal/Ethical: Needs note on preserving Independent Custodian attribution when charters are redrafted.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- Clarify whether ethical change logs must be disclosed publicly or can remain internal.
- Specify review cadence for semantic registry updates tied to charter terms.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Add reference to 	exttt{appendix-e-privacy-and-safety} when charters cover dignity protections.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- How charter promises translate into day-to-day rules.
- Where staff can verify the latest ethical commitments.
