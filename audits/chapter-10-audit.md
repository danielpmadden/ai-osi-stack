# Chapter 10 — Layer 7 Governance Publication Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Provides structured disclosure pipeline supporting EU AI Act transparency obligations.
- Enterprise lens: Gives communications teams standard formats, reducing time-to-publish for decisions.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Links oversight findings to public releases, strengthening evidentiary chain.

## Gaps
- Policy: Should mention translation requirements for multilingual jurisdictions.
- Enterprise: Lacks KPIs for measuring publication timeliness and completeness.
- Legal/Ethical: Could indicate how sensitive content is redacted while maintaining accountability.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- Clarify interplay between governance decision summaries and parliamentary reporting obligations.
- Recommend specifying archival retention periods for published artefacts.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Point to 	exttt{appendix-a-normative-vocabulary-and-modal-definitions} when explaining modal usage in public briefs.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- Where citizens can find official Stack decisions.
- How oversight conclusions become public knowledge.
