# Chapter 03 — Layer 0 Civic Mandate Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Explicitly ties civic charters to enforceable artefacts, satisfying democratic accountability expectations.
- Enterprise lens: Provides clear triggers for incident reporting, enabling predictable escalation budgeting.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Reinforces liability pathways for mandate breaches through ledger documentation.

## Gaps
- Policy: Should mention coordination with municipal procurement rules when activating mandates.
- Enterprise: Lacks guidance on staffing public monitors who maintain civic dashboards.
- Legal/Ethical: Could address remedies for communities when mandate evidence is incomplete.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- Recommend adding timeline for publishing civic charter updates after approval.
- Clarify who certifies integrity ledger summaries prior to release.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Cross-reference 	exttt{appendix-g-participation-procedures} in the incident remediation paragraph.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- What makes a mandate legitimate.
- How residents submit evidence of mandate violations.
