# Chapter 15 — Governance Transport and Maturity Model Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Establishes maturity checkpoints that align with ISO/IEC 42001 continuous improvement cycles.
- Enterprise lens: Provides structured playbook for transferring governance between organisations.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Captures audit memo evidence to avoid accountability gaps during handovers.

## Gaps
- Policy: Should note international data transfer implications when responsibilities cross borders.
- Enterprise: Needs guidance on resourcing receiving teams during transition periods.
- Legal/Ethical: Could describe dispute resolution options when transfer readiness is contested.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- Clarify required sign-offs before releasing maturity roadmaps externally.
- Add recommendation for independent validation of transfer packages.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Include reference to 	exttt{appendix-i-audit-readiness} for transfer audit preparations.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- How communities are informed about governance handovers.
- What evidence proves a new custodian is ready.
