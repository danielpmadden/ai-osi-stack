| source/interpretive/chapter-24-governance-paradox.tex | Operational note comment | Tie Canon 24 to AEIP decision rationale evidence. |

## Newly Proposed Evidence Fields
None proposed in this pass.

## Build Status
- `latexmk` not run during this pass. Build verification deferred to Phase 2.

## Open Questions
1. v4 pagination references remain outstanding pending access to the canonical PDF; add provenance citations when source becomes available.
2. Control tables may require additional cross-references from chapter prose to satisfy field labelling requirements in a later pass.
