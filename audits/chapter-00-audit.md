# Chapter 00 — Introduction and Purpose Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Triple Register clarifies scope and links introductory promises to AEIP artefacts, aligning with EU AI Act transparency duties.
- Enterprise lens: Clear narrative on lifecycle accountability helps executives justify investment in AEIP automation.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Strong emphasis on authorship and provenance ensures liability trails remain visible to regulators.

## Gaps
- Policy: Could cite specific oversight cadence to align with ISO/IEC 42001 continuous improvement clauses.
- Enterprise: Adoption rationale workflow mentions AEIP but not staffing expectations for civic liaisons.
- Legal/Ethical: Data integrity discussion references appendices without pointing to dispute resolution response times.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- Add note on audit frequency for introduction-level commitments to reinforce regulatory alignment.
- Explicitly state who maintains the public briefing backlog referenced in AEIP §O.7.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Consider cross-referencing 	exttt{appendix-b-remediation-protocols} when describing public challenge pathways.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- Why the Stack begins with civic consent rather than technology.
- How residents can follow AEIP receipts to trace promises.
