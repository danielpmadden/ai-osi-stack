# Chapter 14 — Epistemology by Design Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Keeps semantic control aligned with OECD requirements for accountable AI knowledge claims.
- Enterprise lens: Encourages disciplined knowledge management, supporting consistent product messaging.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Tracks provenance of definitions to support legal defensibility of assertions.

## Gaps
- Policy: Could reference national open data policies when documenting knowledge sources.
- Enterprise: Needs tooling guidance for synchronising semantic registries with downstream systems.
- Legal/Ethical: Should address community rights to contest epistemic entries that affect them.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- Clarify who approves integrity ledger updates tied to knowledge changes.
- Add instructions for reconciling conflicting interpretive trace narratives.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Point to 	exttt{appendix-d-glossary-and-terminology} for normative vocabulary governance.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- How the Stack keeps shared definitions honest.
- What happens when evidence contradicts established knowledge.
