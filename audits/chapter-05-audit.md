# Chapter 05 — Layer 2 Data Stewardship Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Connects stewardship duties to structured reporting, supporting EU AI Act risk management obligations.
- Enterprise lens: Clarifies how incident reports and AEIP templates streamline breach readiness operations.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Reinforces consent and remedy pathways, safeguarding data subject rights.

## Gaps
- Policy: Needs explicit tie to cross-border data transfer requirements when using DRR templates.
- Enterprise: Should estimate operational workload for maintaining stewardship dashboards.
- Legal/Ethical: Could detail how long incident artefacts must be retained for civil claims.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- Add guidance on prioritising incident triage when multiple datasets are involved.
- Clarify coordination expectations with privacy officers referenced elsewhere in the Stack.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Include pointer to 	exttt{appendix-f-remedy-manual} alongside incident escalation text.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- What evidence proves data was handled lawfully.
- How communities are notified when stewardship fails.
