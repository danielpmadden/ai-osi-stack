# Chapter 24 — Governance Paradox Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Balances automation assistance with human accountability, supporting democratic oversight norms.
- Enterprise lens: Provides clear disclosure obligations for AI-assisted policymaking teams.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Captures paradox resolutions and ledger entries to demonstrate responsible authority use.

## Gaps
- Policy: Should describe involvement of independent civic panels in paradox reviews.
- Enterprise: Needs workflow guidance for synchronising drafting logs with oversight memo systems.
- Legal/Ethical: Could address rights to appeal when AI-assisted drafting is deemed inappropriate.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- Clarify publication cadence for paradox audit memos.
- Add guidance on recording dissenting opinions alongside final ledger settlements.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Include reference to 	exttt{appendix-g-participation-procedures} for civic engagement during paradox resolutions.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- How to verify humans remain accountable for AI-assisted governance.
- Where to find records of contested policy drafts.
