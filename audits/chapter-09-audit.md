# Chapter 09 — Layer 6 Deployment and Integration Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Aligns deployment gating with EU AI Act conformity assessments and documentation requirements.
- Enterprise lens: Connects go-live rationales to incident triggers, improving operational readiness planning.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Ensures accountability for integration choices through structured decision trails.

## Gaps
- Policy: Should note coordination with cybersecurity baseline obligations when enabling integrations.
- Enterprise: Missing clarity on who funds deployment retrospectives mandated after incidents.
- Legal/Ethical: Could address rights of impacted stakeholders to review launch rationales before rollout.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- State the maximum time allowed between decision rationale capture and production deployment.
- Clarify who owns the oam schema submissions across multi-agency collaborations.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Add link to 	exttt{appendix-b-remediation-protocols} for post-launch corrective actions.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- How a community can inspect why a system was launched.
- What happens when an integration fails in the field.
