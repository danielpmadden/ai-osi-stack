# Chapter 22 — Persona Architecture Audit

## Strengths
- Policy lens: Reinforces governance for persona approvals consistent with broader Stack mandates.
- Enterprise lens: Clarifies lifecycle operations for persona registries, supporting scalability.
- Legal/Ethical lens: Ensures new personas are cross-checked against AEIP coverage to prevent authority creep.

## Gaps
- Policy: Should mention obligations to notify civic bodies before activating sensitive personas.
- Enterprise: Needs tooling recommendations for synchronising persona manifests with HR systems.
- Legal/Ethical: Could detail processes for community appeal against proposed personas.

## Recommended clarifications or additional clauses
- Clarify whether persona manifest updates require public comment windows.
- Add note on documenting dependencies between personas and specific Stack layers.

## Missing schema cross-references
- Include pointer to 	exttt{appendix-j-persona-governance} for further policy guidance.

## Suggested plain-language paragraph topics
- What protections exist before a new persona is activated.
- How communities can track persona changes over time.
