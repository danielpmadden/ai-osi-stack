# Context

## Origins

The AI OSI Stack originated as an attempt to map artificial intelligence governance to the familiar Open Systems Interconnection model. Earlier versions included proprietary integrations and complex control structures. This civic edition removes those dependencies and distills the lessons learned into a public-interest framework that communities can adopt without commercial entanglements.

## Civic Imperatives

- **Stewardship over extraction.** Intelligence systems SHALL support community-defined goals rather than profit-seeking metrics.
- **Transparency over opacity.** Every decision SHOULD be recorded in a Transparency Record that is readable by non-specialists.
- **Education over mystification.** The stack SHALL remain understandable to students, public servants, and community advocates.
- **Care over speed.** Public Attestation Steps SHALL be completed before any deployment affecting people.

## Relationship to Existing Standards

This framework complements, but does not replicate, public sector AI guidelines, open data charters, or academic ethics protocols. It translates those traditions into a layered reference model that can be iterated locally. For comparative insights, consult [../30_REFERENCE/Comparative_Models.md](../30_REFERENCE/Comparative_Models.md).

## Stakeholders

- **Public administrators** who need a shared language to steward AI programs.
- **Community reviewers** who provide accountability and raise concerns.
- **Researchers and educators** who translate technical work into civic literacy.
- **Residents and service users** whose lived experience guides mandate updates.

## Maintaining Alignment

- Layer custodians SHALL host regular open briefings and invite questions.
- Civic Oversight Interface practices SHALL be documented in [../10_LAYERS/L7_Governance_Publication.md](../10_LAYERS/L7_Governance_Publication.md).
- The Open Evidence Interface SHALL use plain-language templates and provide source references wherever possible.
