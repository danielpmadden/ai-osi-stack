# Philosophy and Ethics

## Purpose

This guide articulates the philosophical grounding of the AI OSI Stack, emphasizing civic care, epistemic humility, and ethical responsibility.

## Philosophical Foundations

- **Civic Humanism.** Intelligence serves communal flourishing, not extraction.
- **Pluralism.** Multiple forms of knowledge and experience SHALL inform stewardship.
- **Temporal Responsibility.** Decisions recognize long-term effects, future generations, and historical context.
- **Care Ethics.** Relationships, trust, and mutual support are central to governance.

## Ethical Commitments

1. **Transparency as a Practice.** Disclosure is ongoing, participatory, and accessible.
2. **Accountability with Teeth.** Consequences for harm SHALL be meaningful, restorative, and timely.
3. **Participation as Power.** Communities SHALL influence decisions, not merely observe them.
4. **Learning over Control.** The stack favors adaptive learning over rigid command structures.

## Reflection Activities

- Host community salons to discuss ethical dilemmas using real scenarios.
- Maintain a living anthology of civic essays, testimonies, and research that inform layer updates.
