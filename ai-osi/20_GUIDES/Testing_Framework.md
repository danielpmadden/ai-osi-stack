# Testing Framework

## Purpose

This framework provides a civic alternative to proprietary testing suites. It ensures that evaluation activities align with mandate, ethics, and participation requirements.

## Testing Principles

1. **Civic Relevance.** Tests SHALL measure outcomes that matter to the public, not solely technical performance.
2. **Transparency.** Methods, data, and results SHALL be documented through the Open Evidence Interface.
3. **Inclusivity.** Community members SHOULD co-design test scenarios, especially those reflecting lived experience.
4. **Iterative Learning.** Testing SHALL inform future improvements and be repeated after major changes.

## Test Categories

| Category | Description | Linked Layers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mandate Alignment** | Confirms services fulfill the civic mandate. | [L0 Civic Mandate](../10_LAYERS/L0_Civic_Mandate.md) |
| **Ethics Compliance** | Checks safeguards and prohibitions. | [L1 Ethical Charter](../10_LAYERS/L1_Ethical_Charter.md) |
| **Data Integrity** | Validates consent, quality, and minimization practices. | [L2 Data Stewardship](../10_LAYERS/L2_Data_Stewardship.md) |
| **Model Performance** | Evaluates accuracy, bias, and robustness. | [L3 Model Development](../10_LAYERS/L3_Model_Development.md) |
| **Instruction Safety** | Assesses prompt handling and override procedures. | [L4 Instruction Control](../10_LAYERS/L4_Instruction_Control.md) |
| **Reasoning Quality** | Reviews interpretability and contestation responses. | [L5 Reasoning Exchange](../10_LAYERS/L5_Reasoning_Exchange.md) |
| **Operational Readiness** | Tests deployment resilience and support systems. | [L6 Deployment Integration](../10_LAYERS/L6_Deployment_Integration.md) |
| **Publication Accuracy** | Ensures reports reflect current status. | [L7 Governance Publication](../10_LAYERS/L7_Governance_Publication.md) |
| **Participation Health** | Measures engagement, grievance resolution, and trust. | [L8 Civic Participation](../10_LAYERS/L8_Civic_Participation.md) |

## Testing Process

1. **Plan.** Define objectives, participants, and evaluation metrics using the Implementation Guide.
2. **Collect Evidence.** Use open forms, interviews, and community observations to capture results.
3. **Analyze.** Synthesize findings with attention to equity and accessibility impacts.
4. **Publish.** Share results through the Civic Oversight Interface, including remediation plans.
5. **Follow Up.** Track remediation progress and document completion in the Transparency Record.

## Tools and Templates

- Use spreadsheets or open-source documentation tools to track results.
- Provide audio or visual summaries for communities with varied access needs.
- Archive test artifacts in accessible repositories with clear versioning.
