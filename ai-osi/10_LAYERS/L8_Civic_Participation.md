- **Feedback Portals.** Accessible digital or paper forms that feed directly into the Transparency Record.
- **Community Partnerships.** Long-term collaborations with civic organizations, schools, and advocacy groups.
- **Grievance Processes.** Clear, trauma-informed pathways for raising concerns and seeking remedies.
