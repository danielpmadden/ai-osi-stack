# L2 Data Stewardship

## Purpose

Layer 2 ensures data is collected, curated, and retired in ways that respect human dignity and legal obligations. It SHALL minimize risk and center consent.

## Stewardship Principles

- **Necessity.** Collect only what is required to fulfill the civic mandate.
- **Consent.** Obtain explicit, revocable consent with accessible explanations.
- **Equity.** Audit datasets for representation gaps and potential harms.
- **Security.** Protect data using open, well-documented controls; avoid proprietary lock-in.
- **Sunset.** Define retention periods and deletion protocols.

## Required Artefacts

| Artefact | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Data Inventory** | Table listing sources, purpose, consent status, and retention timelines. |
| **Consent Templates** | Plain-language forms aligned with the Ethical Charter. |
| **Risk Narratives** | Descriptions of foreseeable harms and mitigation steps. |
| **Data Sharing Notices** | Public statements explaining how data flows within and outside the organization. |

## Coordination

- Collaborate with [L3 Model Development](L3_Model_Development.md) to ensure data suitability.
- Provide documentation to [L5 Reasoning Exchange](L5_Reasoning_Exchange.md) for explainability efforts.
- Share security practices with [../20_GUIDES/Security_Model.md](../20_GUIDES/Security_Model.md).

## Accountability Checklist

- [ ] Data inventory published and kept current.
- [ ] Consent process reviewed with community representatives.
