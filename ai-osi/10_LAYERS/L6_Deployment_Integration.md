# L6 Deployment Integration

## Purpose

Layer 6 aligns operational processes, infrastructure, and human support systems before models are introduced into civic services. It SHALL emphasize readiness, resilience, and transparency.

## Integration Steps

1. **Readiness Assessment.** Evaluate staff capacity, training needs, and infrastructure compatibility.
2. **Scenario Planning.** Document expected use cases, edge cases, and rollback strategies.
3. **Service Mapping.** Show how model outputs connect to public services and human decision makers.
4. **Resilience Measures.** Prepare contingency plans for outages, errors, or community concerns.
