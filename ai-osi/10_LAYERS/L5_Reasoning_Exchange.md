# L5 Reasoning Exchange

## Purpose

Layer 5 manages how insights move between humans and intelligent systems. It SHALL ensure that reasoning processes remain interpretable, contestable, and responsive to civic needs.

## Exchange Principles

- **Mutual Legibility.** Explanations SHALL be understandable to affected communities.
- **Bidirectional Learning.** Feedback from people SHALL inform model improvements and vice versa.
- **Traceability.** Every reasoning exchange SHOULD be linked to data sources, model versions, and instruction sets.
- **Responsiveness.** Concerns raised during exchanges SHALL receive timely responses and remediation plans.

## Required Records

| Record | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Dialogue Logs** | Summaries of significant interactions, with privacy safeguards. |
| **Interpretability Notes** | Documentation of explanation techniques and limitations. |
| **Contestation Register** | List of challenges raised, responses provided, and outcomes. |
| **Learning Updates** | Reports describing how feedback changed models, prompts, or policies. |
