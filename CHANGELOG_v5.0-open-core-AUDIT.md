# Custodial Validation Addendum — v5.0-open-core

## 2025-11-09 — Custodial IP Defense and Validation Lock

- Confirmed that the v5.0-open-core tree remains free of proprietary runtime code and that `.gitignore` excludes private workspaces (`analytics/`, `backend/`, `govspine/`, `protocol/`, `ml/`, `ops/`, `tools/`, `tests/`, `commercial/`, `briefing/`).
- Inserted custodial headers across LaTeX and Markdown sources reiterating v5.0-open-core authorship and provenance obligations.
- Added canonical custodianship statements to `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and all `LEGAL/` memoranda, reinforcing that unauthorized forks and runtime derivatives are unofficial.
- Published updated provenance declaration in `CANONICAL_PROVENANCE.yaml` and a SHA-512 integrity manifest at `meta/v5-open-core-sha512-manifest.txt`.
- Logged the audit summary in `_ip_review/REPO_AUDIT_V5-LOCK.md` and refreshed legal notices disavowing unofficial mirrors.

This addendum does not increment the version tag; it documents the custodial lock applied to the existing v5.0-open-core release lineage.
