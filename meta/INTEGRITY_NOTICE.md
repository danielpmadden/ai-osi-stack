# Integrity Notice — AI OSI Stack v5

Checksum verification is recommended for archival reproducibility.
This repository does not include formal cryptographic signing or authoritative hashes.
Users may record SHA-512 or equivalent checksums independently for provenance.

## Advisory Integrity Workflow
1. Acquire the canonical artifacts (`versions/ai-osi-stack-v5.pdf`, `meta/v5-manifest.yaml`, AEIP schemas) from the repository or a trusted mirror.
2. Generate personal checksums with local tooling (e.g., `sha512sum <path>` or `shasum -a 512 <path>`).
3. Record the results in a personal log, noting the commit hash, retrieval date, and storage location.
4. Store this notice alongside your log so future reviewers understand the advisory integrity model.

## Suggested Log Template
| Artifact | Path | SHA-512 (recorded by verifier) | Timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Canonical PDF | `versions/ai-osi-stack-v5.pdf` | `<your computed value>` | `<ISO 8601>` |
| Canonical Manifest | `meta/v5-manifest.yaml` | `<your computed value>` | `<ISO 8601>` |
| AEIP Schema (example) | `schemas/aeip/aeip-frame-schema.json` | `<your computed value>` | `<ISO 8601>` |

Use the template as a reference; expand it to cover any additional files required for your archival process.
