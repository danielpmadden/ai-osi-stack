\chapter{Appendix E — Sources Provenance}
\section*{Narrative Intent}
Appendix E documents provenance attestations for datasets, models, and governance artifacts. It ensures
every source influencing the Stack can be traced back to originators with clarity on licensing and custody.

\section*{Normative Clauses}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Provenance Records.} Custodians SHALL maintain provenance statements including origin, chain of
        custody, and licensing terms.
  \item \textbf{Verification.} Provenance entries SHALL be verified during audits, with discrepancies triggering
        Appendix B escalation.
  \item \textbf{Public Disclosure.} Non-sensitive provenance information SHALL be made public to reinforce civic
        trust.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Provenance Fields}
\begin{description}
  \item[Source Identifier] Unique reference linking to datasets or documents.
  \item[Originator] Individual or institution responsible for creation.
  \item[Custody Chain] Record of stewardship transitions.
  \item[License] Terms governing reuse, including CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0 alignment.
\end{description}

\section*{Plain-Speak Summary}
Provenance answers the question “Where did this come from?” This appendix explains how each dataset or
reference is traced, who handled it, and what rules apply.
