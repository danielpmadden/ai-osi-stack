% Appendix B — Remediation & Response
\narrative{
Appendix B narrates the remediation framework that activates when obligations are breached or harms are identified. It outlines notification timelines, stakeholder coordination, and public accountability rituals. Stories describe prior remediations, including pauses in model operation and reparative engagements with affected communities.

The appendix emphasises restorative justice, ensuring that remediation addresses root causes and rebuilds trust. It highlights how remediation records feed into meta-audit cycles and inform future policy updates.
