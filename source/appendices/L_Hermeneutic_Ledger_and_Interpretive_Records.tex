% Appendix L — Hermeneutic Ledger & Interpretive Records
\narrative{
Appendix L tells the story of the hermeneutic ledger, the interpretive record system that undergirds transparency. The narrative explores ledger design principles, including append-only entries, dual-register annotations, and public attestation workflows. Examples showcase how the ledger preserves community narratives alongside technical telemetry.

The appendix records how ledger insights informed policy revisions, participatory research, and resilience planning.
