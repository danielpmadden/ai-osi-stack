% Appendix D — Glossary & Terminology
\narrative{
Appendix D expands on glossary terms referenced throughout the stack. Each entry captures narrative context, historical usage, and translation considerations. The glossary supports multilingual engagement by providing descriptors that can be adapted without losing civic meaning.

The appendix also identifies deprecated terms from earlier editions, explaining why they were retired and what replacements should be used. This ensures clarity when cross-referencing archival materials.
