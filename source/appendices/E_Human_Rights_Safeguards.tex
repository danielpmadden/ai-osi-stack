% Appendix E — Human Rights Safeguards
\narrative{
Appendix E narrates the human rights safeguards embedded in the stack. It connects each safeguard to international frameworks and local commitments gathered through community consultations. Stories highlight how these safeguards protected vulnerable populations during experimentation and deployment.

The appendix contextualises rights impact assessments, grievance mechanisms, and accountability checkpoints. It emphasises that safeguards are proactive measures designed alongside those most affected.

Safeguard inventories SHALL map to each stack layer and MUST include monitoring metrics. Any indication of rights infringement SHALL trigger immediate remediation under Appendix B and MUST be reported to oversight bodies specified in Appendix H.
