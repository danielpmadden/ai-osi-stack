arrative{
Appendix O merges version~5 custodianship guidance with the advisory integrity posture adopted after the precision-to-realisation update.
Provenance engineer Lior and legal custodian Amara now facilitate a release ceremony oriented around transparency and documentation rather
than cryptographic signing. Civic observers still gather, but the emphasis is on recording context, stewardship roles, and checksum guidance
that witnesses can reproduce independently. The provenance room is treated as both archive and forum—each artefact is explained, catalogued,
and linked to AEIP records without asserting authoritative signatures.
}


arrative{
The workflow starts with the AEIP Frame witness bundle. Every canonical artefact—PDF, manifest, ledger snapshot, schema registry, and
Integrity Notice—is referenced with advisory checksum hints and contextual notes. Witnesses from the public roster record how they captured
their own hashes, which tools were used, and where logs are stored. The narrative enumerates how provenance entries link to Appendix~B
incident timelines, Appendix~C maturity stages, and Appendix~P advisory integrity steps. Readers leave with a complete picture of how to
document provenance in a self-auditing, community-verifiable manner.

ormative{
Canonical artefacts \shall{include advisory checksum fields that direct verifiers to capture their own results}. Metadata \shall{capture}
custodian identity, stewardship role, retrieval timestamp, checksum method, and storage location of personal logs. These entries \shall{be}
published in 	exttt{schemas/aeip/aeip-frame-schema.json} and \shall{be mirrored in Appendix~N so civic reviewers can understand the
provenance record}. Civic witnesses \should{note the jurisdiction, oversight mandate, and verification channel used for their logs}. No
release \may{describe itself as cryptographically signed within this repository}.
}


ormative{
Custodians \shall{follow Appendix~H protocols for role continuity and access control}. Advisory provenance logs \shall{record any custody
change, toolchain update, or checksum regeneration}. Suspected compromise \shall{trigger immediate review of stored logs, notification to
Layer~8 governance channels, and publication of a remediation addendum in Appendix~L}. Custodians \should{maintain a witness roster with
contact channels and jurisdictional authorities so audits \may{verify witness independence}.}

	extbf{Advisory Provenance Example.} The snippet below demonstrates how AEIP witness and custodian entries record checksum guidance instead
