% Appendix C — Change Log & Lineage
\narrative{
Appendix C documents the change log for AI OSI Stack v5, linking every amendment to its source deliberation. Narrative sections provide context for each update plan, summarising community input and governance decisions. The appendix functions as a historical ledger, ensuring the canonical edition remains transparent about its evolution.

Entries highlight dependencies across layers and note when companion tools or schemas were introduced. By consolidating lineage information, the appendix supports traceability and aids future editors in assessing impact.
