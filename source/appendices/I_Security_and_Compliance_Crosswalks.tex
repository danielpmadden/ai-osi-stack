% Appendix I — Security & Compliance Crosswalks
\narrative{
Appendix I narrates how the stack aligns with security and compliance frameworks. It maps controls to regulatory requirements such as GDPR, NIST SP 800-53, and local privacy acts. The narrative explains how crosswalks were developed collaboratively with legal advisors and community watchdogs.

Examples demonstrate how crosswalks guided risk assessments, procurement decisions, and independent audits. The appendix underscores the commitment to exceeding minimum compliance.
