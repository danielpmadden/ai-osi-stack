\chapter{Appendix A — Standards Crosswalk}
\section*{Narrative Intent}
This appendix captures the crosswalk from Version 4 clauses to their Version 5 counterparts. It documents
how civic obligations were reframed, expanded, or otherwise refined, providing auditors with a clear
lineage between historical commitments and the current layered architecture.

\section*{Normative Clauses}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Traceability.} Custodians SHALL maintain this crosswalk as the authoritative record mapping
        historical clauses to Version 5 artifacts.
  \item \textbf{Change Logging.} Updates to the crosswalk SHALL reference Appendix C to preserve transparency
        about revisions and rationale.
  \item \textbf{Public Access.} The crosswalk SHALL be published alongside governance updates to support civic
        verification and comparative analysis.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Plain-Speak Summary}
This appendix explains how Version 4 material maps to Version 5. It lists each old clause, shows where it
lives now, and summarizes what changed so reviewers can trace commitments over time.
