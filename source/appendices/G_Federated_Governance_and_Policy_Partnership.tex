% Appendix G — Federated Governance & Policy Partnership
\narrative{
Appendix G narrates the policy partnership charter that binds federation members. It describes shared decision-making forums, policy harmonisation sprints, and dispute resolution councils. The appendix records milestones from Update Plan 13, including the establishment of the Federated Cohort Registry.

Narrative examples demonstrate how partners co-designed protocols for cross-border data stewardship and aligned redress procedures.
