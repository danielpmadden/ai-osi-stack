\narrative{
Chapter 19A studies how millions of people invoke foundation models in daily decision-making, civic discourse, and crisis response. It distils empirical telemetry from global ChatGPT deployments into narratives about expectation, reliance, and emergent etiquette. Usage data is translated into civic evidence: which prompts become policy artefacts, how communities negotiate translation, and where semantic drift undermines trust. The chapter maps behavioural cohorts—public servants, educators, mutual-aid volunteers—and traces how they anchor meaning within the Stack’s custodial guarantees. Evidence from AEIP attestations and ledger annotations demonstrates why semantic governance must expand beyond engineering controls into social observatories.

These stories surface the social reality of model mediation. They show how citizens evaluate disclosure cues, compare machine and human testimony, and challenge inconsistencies through participatory audits. The narrative closes on a federated workshop where stewards reconcile conflicting interpretations using Appendix L hermeneutic protocols, proving that interpretive stewardship is inseparable from trustworthy deployment.

\normative{
Custodians SHALL maintain interpretive observatories that correlate high-volume usage patterns with semantic integrity metrics. Participating institutions MUST publish AEIP evidence of how prompt taxonomies, refusal policies, and disclosure statements evolve under civic feedback. When empirical data reveals semantic drift, custodians SHALL convene cross-layer councils to apply remediation protocols defined in Appendices B and L before updating public commitments.

Deployments leveraging Stack-aligned models MUST ensure that trust signals—provenance banners, refusal rationales, and policy glossaries—remain verifiable against ledger records. Civic feedback loops SHALL be open to independent researchers under transparency-with-consent principles so that social reality remains legible, contestable, and governed.
