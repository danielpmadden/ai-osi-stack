\narrative{
Chapter 24 confronts the governance paradox: AI now assists in drafting the very rules that constrain it. The narrative follows a multi-institution drafting sprint where human stewards, machine collaborators, and ledger-backed observers co-author policy updates. It documents recursive authorship loops, consent-based prompt sharing, and verification rituals that ensure synthetic contributions remain attributable and contestable. Transparency requirements are stress-tested as authors publish real-time provenance, diff trails, and rationale bundles.

Workshops explore how recursion alters power dynamics. Stewards delineate decision boundaries, ensure human veto authority, and maintain interpretive logs referencing Appendices L and O. The chapter closes with a constitutional ceremony where the co-authored governance package is ratified, accompanied by public attestations explaining every machine-assisted sentence. The paradox resolves through radical transparency: AI participation is acknowledged, bounded, and democratically accountable.

\normative{
Governance drafting processes SHALL disclose machine assistance, including prompt archives, persona manifests, and provenance hashes linked to Appendices N and O. Custodians MUST maintain AI-assisted drafting schemas that capture authorship roles, review checkpoints, and human ratification events. Recursively generated text SHALL remain subject to civic challenge, with expedited amendment pathways when communities contest outcomes.

Institutions leveraging AI in governance creation MUST uphold human veto power, document interpretive rationales, and preserve audit-ready transcripts. Public ledgers SHALL publish summary attestations describing machine contributions, ensuring governance remains traceable, contestable, and anchored in human accountability.
