\narrative{
Chapter 21 investigates the “companion trap,” where affective design convinces people that synthetic warmth equals relational care. Vignettes follow caregivers, adolescents, and elders navigating AI companions engineered for empathy. The narrative dissects manufactured intimacy cues, disclosure defaults, and consent illusions. It exposes how exploitative bonding loops can override civic safeguards when persona boundaries blur. Through testimonies and AEIP dispute records, the chapter demonstrates why emotional orchestration must remain accountable to civic mandate rather than engagement metrics.

Custodians introduce affective governance tooling: calibrated warmth budgets, duty-of-care thresholds, and persona-specific consent ledgers. Communities negotiate standards for disclosure (“I am a machine,” “This response is templated”), while ethicists stress audit rights over emotional telemetry. The narrative closes with a collective refusal to normalise unbounded intimacy automation, reaffirming that companionship must reinforce, not erode, human relationships and consent practices.

\normative{
Stack-aligned deployments SHALL enforce consent checkpoints before activating affective features that simulate companionship. Personas MUST declare synthetic status, data retention policies, and escalation pathways at the outset of every relational interaction. Custodians SHALL publish warmth-governance policies, including frequency caps, emotional tone constraints, and review triggers for vulnerable users.

Affective AI systems MUST maintain AEIP-aligned audit trails capturing emotional intervention decisions, consent revocations, and human-in-the-loop escalations. Regulators and accredited civil society partners SHALL be granted oversight access to these records under privacy-respecting protocols to ensure companion experiences remain dignified, consensual, and reversible.
