\section*{Hybrid Tone Guidance}
The AI OSI Stack v5 Canon is presented in a hybrid tone that balances academic rigor with accessible plain-speak orientation. Each chapter is authored using the Triple Register: Narrative Intent to frame objectives, Normative Clauses to establish binding guidance, and Plain-Speak Summary to translate commitments into everyday language.
