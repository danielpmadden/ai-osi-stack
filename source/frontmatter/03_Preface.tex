% Preface — AI OSI Stack v5
\narrative{
Version 5 of the AI OSI Stack is the culmination of a civic rebuild conducted between 3–5 November 2025, consolidating the accumulated Update Plans, public consultations, and pilot feedback into a single canonical governance architecture. This preface explains why the stack advances beyond the v1–v4.2.x lineage: it merges research on constitutional technology, community-led accountability, and interoperable audit tooling so that the governance layers function as a living constitution rather than a static policy memo. Readers are invited to engage the text as both practical manual and civic covenant, recognising that transparency, participation, and human-rights guarantees must coevolve with technical capability.

The supersession notice affirms that v5 integrates Updates 1–10, codifies the baseline human-rights protections referenced throughout Appendix E, and anchors all derived artifacts to the canonical provenance held on \texttt{danielpmadden.com}. It also introduces the AEIP evidence paths and signatures that bind each chapter to verifiable custodial obligations, ensuring future revisions can be inspected without erasing the commitments negotiated with the public.

All prior releases from v1 through v4.2.x, including interim drafts, ARE HEREBY SUPERSEDED as of 4 November 2025. Custodians SHALL reference the canonical provenance statement, signature bundle, and hash manifest prior to distributing or implementing any governance artifacts. Any amendment to this preface MUST document lineage in Appendix C, SHALL cite the superseded version identifiers, and SHALL preserve the non-revocable principle “Transparency must never become surveillance.” Implementers SHALL treat the incorporated Update Plans 1–10 as binding context and SHALL map their deployments to the AEIP registers indicated in this edition before claiming compliance.
