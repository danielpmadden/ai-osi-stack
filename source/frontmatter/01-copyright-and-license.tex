\narrative{
The canonical AI OSI Stack remains a civic work entrusted to public scrutiny. The license terms preserve broad sharing while
guarding against derivative dilution that could obscure obligations negotiated with communities. Historical releases archived in
\texttt{versions/historical/} show how each edition clarified rights and safeguards; Version 5 binds those histories into a
non-revocable commitment to transparency without surveillance. Citizens, policymakers, implementers, and academics are invited to
study, teach, and debate the stack, provided they respect the custodial provenance recorded in the signature bundles.
