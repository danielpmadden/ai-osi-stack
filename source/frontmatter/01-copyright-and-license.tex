\narrative{
The canonical AI OSI Stack remains a civic work entrusted to public scrutiny. License terms preserve broad sharing while guarding against
derivative dilution that could obscure obligations negotiated with communities. Historical releases archived in
\texttt{versions/historical/} show how each edition clarified rights and safeguards; Version 5 binds those histories into a non-revocable
commitment to transparency without surveillance. Citizens, policymakers, implementers, and academics are invited to study, teach, and debate
the stack, provided they respect the custodial provenance recorded in the advisory integrity workflow.\\[6pt]
