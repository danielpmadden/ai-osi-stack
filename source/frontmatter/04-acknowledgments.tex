\narrative{
This rebuild is indebted to the civic technologists, municipal archivists, policy makers, educators, and independent auditors who
scrutinised every update plan from Version 1 onward. Workshops hosted during the 2024–2025 consultation cycles exposed where
transparency commitments risked collapsing into surveillance, prompting the refined interpretive principles that anchor this
edition. Persona Architecture v2 drew directly from community-led simulations of deliberative bodies, while Epistemology by Design
v1 incorporated critiques from librarians and epistemologists who insisted that evidence trails remain legible to the public.

Custodians \shall{} maintain public acknowledgement records identifying Independent Custodians and reviewers across each canonical release.
Entities reusing this framework \should{} recognise local participants and \shall{} disclose any omissions or redactions. When civic
feedback results in substantive amendments, implementers \shall{} record the lineage in (AEIP §O.6) annotations and \shall{} publish
thank-you notices consistent with Appendix G participation protocols. Neglecting acknowledgement duties \shall{} trigger a custodial
review under Appendix H.
