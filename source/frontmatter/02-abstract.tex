% Abstract — AI OSI Stack v5 Deepbuild
\narrative{
Version 5 situates the AI OSI Stack as a constitutional scaffold for socio-technical governance. The abstract summarises how the
layers align civic mandates, ethical charters, data stewardship, model development, instruction governance, and reasoning
exchange into a single lifecycle anchored by the AI Epistemic Infrastructure Protocol (AEIP). Drawing from the Version 5 Draft,
the Persona Architecture v2 blueprint, and the Update Plans, this edition restores the narrative of why public consent, evidentiary
records, and cooperative enforcement are inseparable. Each chapter doubles as a ledger entry: it describes the obligations and the
historical rationale negotiated with citizens and implementers between 2022 and 2025.
}
\normative{
Adopting jurisdictions \shall{} implement Layers 0 through 5 alongside the companion layers documented in Chapters 09–11.
Compliance assertions \shall{} be recorded as AEIP evidence artifacts referencing (AEIP §§O.3–O.7). Custodians \shall{} maintain
publicly accessible registries of commitments, appeal channels, and remediation workflows, citing Appendix E §3 for privacy and
redress safeguards. Stakeholders \may{} utilise the stack for education or policy harmonisation provided they reference this edition
as the canonical text and maintain provenance hashes across derivative workspaces.
