% Custodianship Notice — AI OSI Stack v5 Deepbuild
\narrative{
Custodianship resides with Daniel P. Madden, who compiled, signed, and published this edition following the deepbuild window of
3–5 November 2025. The historical ledger in \texttt{versions/historical/} captures every prior stewardship decision, including
public comment roundups, integrity notices, and update plan reconciliations. Custodianship is not a private prerogative but a
civic duty executed in the open: signatures, release hashes, and AEIP evidence records ensure that citizens can verify custodial
claims without deference to institutional gatekeepers.
}
\normative{
The custodian \shall{} publish annual attestations reaffirming stewardship obligations, referencing (AEIP §O.3) provenance hooks and
Appendix H succession protocols. Any transfer of custodianship MUST be announced through the canonical channels, \shall{} provide a
transition timeline, and \shall{} enumerate responsibilities carried forward. Implementers referencing this work \shall{} verify the
custodian’s current status through \texttt{INTEGRITY\_NOTICE.md}. Unauthorized parties \shall{not} represent themselves as
custodians and MUST include conspicuous disclaimers if they distribute ancillary material or commentary.
