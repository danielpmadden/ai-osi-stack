% Acknowledgments — AI OSI Stack v5 Deepbuild
\narrative{
This rebuild is indebted to the civic technologists, municipal archivists, policy makers, educators, and independent auditors who
scrutinised every update plan from Version 1 onward. Workshops hosted during the 2024–2025 consultation cycles exposed where
transparency commitments risked collapsing into surveillance, prompting the refined interpretive principles that anchor this
edition. Persona Architecture v2 drew directly from community-led simulations of deliberative bodies, while Epistemology by Design
v1 incorporated critiques from librarians and epistemologists who insisted that evidence trails remain legible to the public.

feedback results in substantive amendments, implementers SHALL record the lineage in (AEIP §O.6) annotations and SHALL publish
thank-you notices consistent with Appendix G participation protocols. Neglecting acknowledgement duties SHALL trigger a custodial
review under Appendix H.
