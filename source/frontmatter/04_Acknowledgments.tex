\narrative{
The custodial team thanks the civic participants, policy advocates, and independent researchers who scrutinised each update plan between Versions 1 and 5. Their public comments, workshop interventions, and verification efforts shaped the commitments documented herein. Appreciation is also extended to the communities who piloted disclosure practices and stress-tested the AEIP pathways, demonstrating that governance innovation thrives when the public remains a co-author rather than an audience.
