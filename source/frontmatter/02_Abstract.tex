% Abstract — AI OSI Stack v5
\narrative{
The AI OSI Stack is presented as a governance architecture that braids civic mandates, ethical design, and technical execution into a layered social contract. The narrative abstract frames Version 5 as the consolidation of public consultations, update plans, and canonical provenance records hosted on \texttt{danielpmadden.com}. It explains how the stack translates democratic expectations into operational controls for data stewardship, model development, instruction governance, and deployment accountability so that communities can interrogate and trust the AI systems deployed in their name.
