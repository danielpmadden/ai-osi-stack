% Table of Contents Placeholder — AI OSI Stack v5 Deepbuild
\narrative{
The canonical build expects the LaTeX engine to generate the table of contents during compilation. This placeholder persists so
that automated pipelines detect the front matter boundary and integrate AEIP cross-references. Historical drafts used manual
placeholders, but Version 5 standardises the workflow: the ToC emerges from the chapter inputs defined in \texttt{source/chapters}.
}
\normative{
Publication pipelines \shall{} compile the table of contents directly from the source tree. They \shall{not} substitute truncated or
handcrafted indices. When distributing derivative formats, custodians \shall{} ensure the generated ToC aligns with the canonical
chapter ordering and \shall{} document the compilation hash in (AEIP §O.5) records. Automated builds \may{} insert additional lists of
figures or tables provided they do not omit mandated entries.
