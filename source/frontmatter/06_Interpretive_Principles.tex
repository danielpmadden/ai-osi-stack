% Interpretive Principles — AI OSI Stack v5
\narrative{
Interpretive principles orient readers toward the civic ethic underpinning every layer of the stack. They explain that “Transparency must never become surveillance.” is the non-revocable baseline guiding disclosures, audits, and public participation. The narrative frames these principles as the connective tissue between constitutional values, the AEIP evidence trail, and the safeguards elaborated in Appendix E. It situates each principle as a lens for adjudicating conflicts between operational urgency and human dignity, ensuring the architecture remains legible to citizens, policymakers, and implementers alike.
