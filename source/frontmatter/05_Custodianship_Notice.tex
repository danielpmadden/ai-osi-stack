% Custodianship Notice — AI OSI Stack v5
\narrative{
Custodial stewardship for the AI OSI Stack traces a rapid canonicalisation window between 3 and 5 November 2025. During this period Daniel P. Madden consolidated Versions 1 through 5, recorded provenance attestations on \texttt{danielpmadden.com}, and archived the signed releases within the public repository at \texttt{github.com/danielpmadden/ai-osi-stack}. The narrative timeline documents how each update plan, civic comment cycle, and AEIP refinement converged into the present edition, ensuring that the governance architecture remains accountable to the communities it serves.
}
\normative{
Custodians SHALL maintain signature bundles, hash manifests, and release notes in alignment with the canonical provenance statement. Verification MUST reference \texttt{INTEGRITY\_NOTICE.md} and corresponding AEIP artifacts before recognising any derivative publication as authentic. Non-canonical forks SHALL disclose their divergence prominently and SHALL NOT claim custodial authority. Transfer of custodianship SHALL follow the succession safeguards enumerated in Appendix H, and every custodian MUST renew the public attestation annually or upon any material change to governance scope.
