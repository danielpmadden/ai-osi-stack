\narrative{
This colophon reaffirms the split licensing of AI OSI Stack v5. Documentation remains under CC BY-SA 4.0 and implementation code under
Apache License 2.0 so communities can study, adapt, and operationalise the framework without surrendering civic intent. The author reiterates
that governance tooling is a public trust and that licensing choices protect both openness and accountability.

There is no institutional, corporate, or governmental backing. Any references to organizations, domains, or future bodies are aspirational
placeholders for a community that does not yet exist.

\paragraph*{AI Assistance Disclosure}

\normative{
Redistributors \shall{} preserve the license split when sharing derivatives. Implementers \should{} cite the Integrity Notice and advisory
provenance workflow whenever publishing new builds. Civic bodies \may{} reference this colophon in procurement or oversight documentation to
underline the project’s independent authorship and licensing commitments.
