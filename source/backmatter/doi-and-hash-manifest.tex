% Backmatter — DOI and Advisory Manifest Guidance
\narrative{
The DOI and advisory manifest section lists canonical identifiers for AI OSI Stack v5 artifacts. It explains the process for assigning
digital object identifiers, recording advisory checksum guidance, and publishing manifest notes on danielpmadden.com for public review.
Narrative sections emphasise that provenance depends on community-verified logs rather than repository-issued signatures.
}
\normative{
Each canonical artifact \shall{} include a DOI, retrieval timestamp, and checksum guidance that directs verifiers to record their own results.
Advisory manifests \shall{} be updated upon publication of new artifacts and MUST retain historical entries for auditability. Verification
instructions \should{} reference Appendix~P and the Integrity Notice so readers understand how to perform independent logging.

\textbf{Deterministic Build Note.} To reproduce this canonical PDF: \texttt{docker build -f Dockerfile.latex . \&\& latexmk -pdf ai-osi-stack-v5.tex}.
Capture the resulting commit hash and checksum in your personal log alongside the Integrity Notice.
