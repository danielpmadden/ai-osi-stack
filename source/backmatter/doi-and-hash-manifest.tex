% Backmatter — DOI and Hash Manifest
\narrative{
The DOI and hash manifest lists canonical identifiers for AI OSI Stack v5 artifacts. It explains the process for assigning digital object identifiers, generating cryptographic hashes, and publishing the manifest on danielpmadden.com for public verification. Narrative sections provide context on how these identifiers support provenance and tamper detection.
}
\normative{
Each canonical artifact SHALL include a DOI, hash value, issuance timestamp, and custodial signer reference. Hash algorithms MUST meet current cryptographic standards and SHALL be rotated according to security guidance in Appendix I. Manifests SHALL be updated upon publication of new artifacts and MUST retain historical entries for auditability. Verification instructions SHALL reference Appendix N resources.
