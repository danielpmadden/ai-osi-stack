% Purpose: Canonical chapter content for Layer 4
\narrative{
Layer 4 focuses on instruction design and control surfaces that mediate how humans interact with deployed models. The narrative explains the pedagogy of prompt engineering, policy alignment, and guardrail scripting carried out through the rebuild. Examples show how instruction sets were co-created with subject-matter experts to preserve context sensitivity and cultural respect.

Control mechanisms—including override workflows, audit triggers, and disengagement options—are explored through stories of field testing. The chapter demonstrates how iterative feedback from civic partners informed refinements to instruction repositories and controller APIs.

\normative{
Layer 4 SHALL maintain a controlled instruction registry with versioned change logs and AEIP signatures. All instruction sets SHALL document provenance, stakeholder reviewers, and intended scope. Control systems MUST provide manual override capabilities and SHALL enforce rate-limited disengagement when risk thresholds are exceeded. Instruction updates SHALL not be deployed without recorded consent where applicable and MUST be linked to Layer 5 reasoning contracts.
