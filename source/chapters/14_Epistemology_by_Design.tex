\narrative{
Epistemology by Design reframes system development as an epistemic craft. The narrative synthesises methodologies that ensure knowledge claims are transparent, contestable, and situated. It recounts workshop practices where stakeholders co-produced interpretive frames, aligning machine reasoning with human narratives.

The chapter explores how epistemic commitments influence metrics, evidence curation, and audit rituals. It highlights the hermeneutic ledger as an embodiment of epistemic accountability, preserving interpretive context alongside quantitative signals.

\normative{
Epistemic design practices SHALL require explicit articulation of assumptions, uncertainties, and contextual boundaries. All artefacts MUST embed interpretive metadata that links outcomes to sources, stewardship roles, and consent status. Governance bodies SHALL conduct epistemic retrospectives after major deployments, documenting findings within the ledger. Metrics SHALL not be approved without demonstrating their social implications and alignment with Layer 0 mandates.
