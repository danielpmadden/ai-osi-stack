% Chapter 02 — Philosophical Foundations
\narrative{
Philosophical closure for the AI OSI Stack asserts that ontological, epistemic, axiological, and teleological assumptions are not abstract debates but documented commitments. The chapter narrates how Epistemology-by-Design research informed Version 5: civic stakeholders demanded that claims about reality, knowledge, values, and purpose be recorded alongside technical specifications. Each stance becomes metadata in the AEIP registers so that implementers, auditors, and the public can inspect why a system exists, what truths it presumes, whose values it encodes, and which outcomes it pursues. By turning philosophy into an operational artifact, the stack prevents hidden value shifts and ensures that moral arguments remain accountable to the communities affected.

\normative{
Implementers SHALL declare ontological, epistemic, axiological, and teleological stances within their AEIP submissions and SHALL version those declarations whenever assumptions change. These stances MUST map to the System Implementation Records (SIRs) that accompany each layer, ensuring traceability between conceptual commitments and operational controls. “Philosophical variance” — the introduction of undocumented assumptions — IS NON-COMPLIANT and SHALL trigger remediation under Appendix B. Custodians SHALL cross-reference stance declarations with validation artefacts, including alignment reviews and civic consultation summaries, and they SHALL publish change histories so that auditors can verify continuity of purpose.
