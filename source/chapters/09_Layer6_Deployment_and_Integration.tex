% Purpose: Canonical chapter content for Layer 6
\narrative{
Layer 6 documents deployment practices and integration pathways. The narrative follows release management routines, change approval boards, and sandbox-to-production promotion cycles. It showcases how deployment blueprints embed civic safeguards, ensuring infrastructure decisions respect the ethical charter and data stewardship commitments.

Integration stories explore collaborations with municipal systems, community dashboards, and external oversight tools. The chapter demonstrates how deployment teams coordinate with federation partners to uphold cross-jurisdictional obligations.
}
\normative{
Layer 6 SHALL require deployment runbooks with rollback, notification, and consent refresh procedures. All integrations MUST reference AEIP lifecycle receipts and SHALL undergo pre-production validation with stakeholder observers. Production changes SHALL not occur without dual sign-off from technical stewards and governance custodians. Integration endpoints MUST comply with security crosswalks defined in Appendix I and SHALL log attestations for Appendix N transparency.
