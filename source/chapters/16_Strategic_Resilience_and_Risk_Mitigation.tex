\narrative{
Strategic resilience narrates the stack's approach to anticipating and mitigating risk. The chapter covers scenario planning, adversarial simulations, and stress-testing of governance processes. It highlights collaborative drills with civic responders and technical teams to validate escalation pathways and redundancy plans.

Narrative accounts describe how resilience work protected vulnerable communities during system outages and how lessons learned fed back into policy updates. The chapter frames resilience as a civic duty, ensuring continuity of essential services and public trust.

\normative{
Resilience programs SHALL maintain threat models, risk registers, and mitigation plans aligned with Update Plans 4 and 5. Critical controls MUST include redundancy for data custody, decision oversight, and communication channels. Regular resilience exercises SHALL be conducted at least semi-annually, with results logged in the hermeneutic ledger. Identified vulnerabilities MUST be remediated within agreed timelines and SHALL be tracked through Appendix M coordination.
