\narrative{
This chapter narrates the governance transport model that enables the stack to operate across institutions. It maps maturity stages—from initiation to resilient federation—and recounts the journeys of partner organisations progressing through these stages. The narrative underscores the importance of shared vocabulary, interoperable tooling, and reciprocal accountability.

Case studies illustrate how transport protocols carried governance artifacts between civic departments and academic collaborators. Lessons learned highlight the need for incremental adoption, continuous education, and investment in custodial capacity.

\normative{
Governance transport SHALL define maturity levels with explicit criteria covering policy alignment, technical integration, and civic participation. Partners MUST document their current stage and SHALL publish roadmaps for advancement. Interoperability packages SHALL include AEIP schemas, federation manifests, and remediation agreements. Graduation between maturity levels SHALL be ratified by joint governance councils and MUST be recorded in the hermeneutic ledger.
