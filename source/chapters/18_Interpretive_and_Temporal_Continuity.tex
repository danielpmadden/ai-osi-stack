% Purpose: Canonical chapter content for interpretive continuity
\narrative{
Interpretive and temporal continuity narrates how the stack preserves meaning across time. The chapter explores version control, historical annotations, and interpretive ledgers that keep context intact. It discusses stewardship rituals for onboarding new custodians and ensuring that institutional memory remains accessible to communities.

Examples include cross-generational dialogues, archival storytelling, and public retrospectives that connect past decisions with present interpretations. The narrative affirms that continuity is essential for maintaining legitimacy and preventing knowledge loss.
}
\normative{
Continuity practices SHALL require timestamped annotations, provenance hashes, and cross-references to prior editions. Custodians MUST maintain interpretive briefs for major decisions and SHALL provide temporal context for policy shifts. Succession plans SHALL include knowledge transfer protocols, and any archival migration MUST preserve narrative and normative registers. Breaks in continuity SHALL be declared publicly and MUST initiate remedial documentation.
