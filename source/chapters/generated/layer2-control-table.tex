\item Data custodians \shall{publish lawful basis statements} for every dataset prior to ingestion.
\item Privacy officers \shall{open an incident ticket within 24 hours} of discovering exposure or misuse.
\item Programme owners \should{issue stewardship summaries to affected communities} with remediation progress.
