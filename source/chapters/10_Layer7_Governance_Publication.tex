% Purpose: Canonical chapter content for Layer 7
\narrative{
Layer 7 explains how governance artifacts are published, archived, and kept discoverable. The narrative describes the editorial workflow for danielpmadden.com, including peer review, citation management, and version stamping. It recounts the establishment of canonical provenance statements and the adoption of DOI plus hash manifests for tamper evidence.

Examples illustrate how public transparency tiers guide dissemination, ensuring sensitive details remain protected while accountability records stay accessible. The chapter emphasises collaborative publication with federation partners to maintain a single source of truth.
