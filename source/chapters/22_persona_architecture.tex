\chapter{Layer 22 — Persona Architecture}
\section{Narrative Intent}
Layer 22 manages the design and governance of personas used within the Stack—curated configurations that
shape how the system presents itself to different audiences. The narrative intent is to ensure personas are
purposeful, ethically grounded, and traceable to civic mandates.

\section{Normative Clauses}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Persona Catalogue.} Custodians SHALL maintain an approved catalogue describing persona goals,
        target audiences, and applicable constraints.
  \item \textbf{Ethical Alignment.} Persona behaviors SHALL be reviewed against the ethical charter to confirm
        they reinforce, rather than undermine, civic obligations.
  \item \textbf{Change Management.} Modifications to persona configurations SHALL follow Appendix C change log
        requirements, documenting rationale and testing outcomes.
  \item \textbf{Decommissioning Controls.} Retired personas SHALL be archived with context explaining removal and
        any mitigation actions taken to address associated risks.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Plain-Speak Summary}
Personas are deliberate choices, not ad hoc tweaks. The team keeps a vetted list, checks each persona against
ethical rules, records changes, and documents why any persona is removed.
