\chapter{Layer 23 — Therapy Tech}
\section{Narrative Intent}
Layer 23 sets boundaries for therapeutic or quasi-therapeutic applications. It aims to prevent harm,
respect professional standards, and ensure that any supportive interventions mediated by AI remain
anchored in accredited practice.

\section{Normative Clauses}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Scope Limitation.} AI-mediated therapeutic features SHALL declare their scope and defer to
        licensed professionals for diagnosis or treatment beyond approved boundaries.
  \item \textbf{Clinical Oversight.} Deployments SHALL include credentialed clinical supervisors responsible for
        reviewing interventions and intervening when risks surface.
  \item \textbf{Consent and Safeguards.} Users SHALL provide informed consent acknowledging capabilities and
        limitations, with emergency pathways to human support.
  \item \textbf{Outcome Monitoring.} Custodians SHALL track therapeutic outcomes and adverse events, reporting
        aggregated insights to relevant regulatory bodies and civic oversight forums.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Plain-Speak Summary}
This layer keeps therapeutic uses careful and honest. AI tools must say what they can and cannot do,
licensed professionals stay in the loop, users understand the limits, and results are monitored for safety.
