% Purpose: Canonical chapter content for epilogue
\narrative{
The epilogue reflects on the stack as a living constitution that must evolve alongside civic expectations. It revisits the journey chronicled across chapters and affirms the shared responsibility to steward technology with humility. The narrative invites readers to imagine future iterations shaped by new communities, emerging rights claims, and technological shifts.

Closing reflections celebrate the resilience of collaborative governance and acknowledge the work that remains. The epilogue underscores that legitimacy is earned through continual practice, transparency, and solidarity with those most affected by automated decisions.

\normative{
The epilogue SHALL reaffirm commitment to iterative governance, declaring that amendments MUST honour the civic mandate and ethical charter. It SHALL instruct custodians to maintain open channels for critique, innovation, and redress. Future editions SHALL document their lineage relative to v5 and MUST preserve access to historical registers. The living constitution metaphor SHALL guide decision-makers to prioritise people over performance metrics at all times.
