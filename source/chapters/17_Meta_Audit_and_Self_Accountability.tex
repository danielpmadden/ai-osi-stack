\narrative{
Meta-audit and self-accountability describe how the stack audits its own governance. The narrative walks through audit cadences, evaluator independence safeguards, and community witness programs. It recounts the evolution of meta-audit criteria, emphasising transparency, replicability, and public reporting.

Stories highlight how self-assessment uncovered blind spots in participation equity and led to corrective investments. The chapter positions meta-audit as an act of civic humility and a mechanism for continuous improvement.

\normative{
Meta-audit programs SHALL operate on a fixed cadence with published scopes, methodologies, and datasets. Audit teams MUST include independent reviewers and SHALL offer community observer seats. Findings SHALL be published in dual registers and MUST specify remediation commitments with deadlines. Failure to complete agreed actions SHALL trigger escalation to custodial oversight councils and MUST be logged for public scrutiny.
