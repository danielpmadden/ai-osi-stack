% Purpose: Canonical chapter content for Layer 1
\narrative{
Layer 1 articulates the ethical charter that operationalises the civic mandate into enforceable commitments. The narrative outlines principles on fairness, transparency, and harm minimisation, drawing from interdisciplinary scholarship and community testimonies. It describes how ethical clauses inform technical safeguards, such as dataset vetting and interpretability requirements.

Case vignettes demonstrate how the charter guided decision-making during previous deployments, including pauses in model rollout and remediation efforts. The chapter explains how the dual-register format keeps ethical language accessible while anchoring compliance obligations.

\normative{
Layer 1 SHALL maintain a catalogue of ethical clauses with explicit mappings to stack controls and AEIP hooks. Every clause SHALL identify measurable indicators for assessment and SHALL specify escalation pathways when breaches are suspected. Ethical waivers SHALL be prohibited unless ratified through the custodial governance process and recorded in the hermeneutic ledger. Implementers MUST provide auditable evidence of adherence during each lifecycle stage.
