\narrative{
Persona architecture integration describes how mediated personas interact with civic actors. The narrative explains the taxonomy of personas—custodial, deliberative, pedagogical—and the safeguards embedded to prevent manipulation. It recounts design sessions where community members co-authored persona briefs to reflect local values and historical context.

The chapter also covers operational tactics for persona rotation, retirement, and re-certification. Stories emphasise how personas remain accountable through transparent scripts, AEIP-linked evidence, and ongoing community evaluation.

\normative{
Persona deployments SHALL include documented purpose statements, guardrails, and escalation protocols. Every persona MUST register with AEIP, including consent considerations for any data references. Persona updates SHALL undergo participatory review and MUST maintain audit logs for prompts and responses. Any persona found to deviate from the civic mandate SHALL be suspended pending remediation, and corrective actions MUST be documented in Appendix B workflows.
