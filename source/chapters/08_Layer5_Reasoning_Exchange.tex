% Purpose: Canonical chapter content for Layer 5
\narrative{
Layer 5 narrates how reasoning exchanges capture deliberative dialogue between models and stakeholders. The chapter describes interpretive session logs, debate protocols, and arbitration formats that ensure outputs remain contestable. It highlights the design of reasoning exchanges as civic forums where evidence, context, and counterfactuals are surfaced in dual registers.

Stories from pilot engagements demonstrate how reasoning exchanges exposed latent biases, triggered remediation, and generated public-facing summaries. The narrative emphasises the connection between these exchanges and the stack's broader goal of sustaining trust.
}
\normative{
Layer 5 SHALL require authenticated logging of all critical reasoning exchanges, including participant roles, decision context, and interpretive annotations. Exchanges MUST be indexed to AEIP receipts and SHALL support public transparency tiers defined in Appendix K. Disputed exchanges SHALL initiate mediation workflows, and their resolutions MUST update Layer 4 instructions and Layer 6 deployment records. Reasoning outputs SHALL never bypass oversight controls.
