% Chapter 01 — Historical and Technical Lineage
\narrative{
The AI OSI Stack inherits its structural metaphor from the Open Systems Interconnection model, translating layered networking insights into a civic governance blueprint. Where the original OSI mapped data exchange across technical strata, this stack maps moral and legal payloads across civic mandates, ethical charters, data stewardship, model development, instructional controls, reasoning exchanges, deployment oversight, governance publication, and civic participation. The historical lineage traces early prototypes, including Versions 1 through 4.2.x, and shows how constitutional governance practices, civil-society consultations, and epistemic accountability research coalesced into Version 5. Continuity is maintained through persistent provenance records, update plans, and public comment archives that document each iteration's rationale and constraints.

\normative{
Custodians SHALL declare lineage for every derivative work, citing prior versions, update plans, and provenance references captured in Appendix C §1. They SHALL document migration paths, deprecated controls, and new obligations within AEIP storage channels (AEIP §O.6), ensuring that evidence of evolution is available for audit. Any break in version integrity MUST be recorded with hashes, signatures, and remediation plans before a deployment claims compliance. Implementers SHALL maintain bidirectional traceability between civic commitments and technical components, and they SHALL publish change summaries that enable citizens to verify that no obligations have been silently retired.
