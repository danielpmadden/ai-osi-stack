% Purpose: Canonical chapter content for Layer 3
\narrative{
Layer 3 chronicles the disciplined approach to model development, from hypothesis framing to evaluation. It highlights collaborative design reviews, dataset readiness checks, and interpretability experiments that were conducted during the v5 rebuild. Narrative attention is given to the interplay between technical ambition and civic safeguards, ensuring that models reflect documented community needs.

The chapter documents tooling such as reproducible notebooks, simulation harnesses, and interpretive trace packages. It describes how these artefacts feed into the AEIP lifecycle validator to guarantee that every release candidate carries the necessary receipts and signatures.
}
\normative{
Layer 3 SHALL define minimum evidence requirements for model readiness, including bias assessments, interpretability artefacts, and safety benchmarks. Development pipelines MUST capture AEIP receipts at each gate and SHALL link them to hermeneutic ledger entries. Experiments SHALL be reproducible, and parameter changes MUST be documented with consent for any affected data subjects. No model SHALL advance to Layer 4 without a validated lifecycle report.
