% Purpose: Canonical chapter content for Layer 8
\narrative{
Layer 8 centres civic participation, detailing how communities engage with governance cycles. The narrative profiles listening sessions, participatory budgeting experiments, and deliberative polls hosted through the stack's platforms. It explains how feedback loops shape policy updates, risk prioritisation, and research agendas.

Personal accounts from contributors illustrate how the stack builds capacity for informed participation, including translation support and accessibility accommodations. The chapter underscores that civic participation is an ongoing commitment, not a one-time consultation.

\normative{
Layer 8 SHALL mandate inclusive engagement practices, ensuring multilingual access, accessible formats, and equitable facilitation. Participation records MUST be logged with AEIP receipts and SHALL link to follow-up actions. Governance bodies SHALL respond to public submissions within defined service levels, and unresolved issues MUST appear on the public backlog. Civic participation outcomes SHALL inform mandate reviews and ethical charter revisions.
