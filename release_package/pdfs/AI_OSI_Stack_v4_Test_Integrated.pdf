(## 3. Architectural Foundations and Methodology) Tj
T*
(The stack is engineered as infrastructure rather than policy prose. Its methodology) Tj
T*
(interleaves architectural decomposition with governance artifacts that provide audit-ready) Tj
T*
(evidence. Layered controls are validated via AEIP-compliant exchanges, ensuring that) Tj
T*
(reasoning states, decision artifacts, and socio-technical context remain inseparable. The) Tj
T*
(methodology favors design patterns that instantiate accountability at system inception,) Tj
T*
(echoing the stance articulated in *The AI OSI Stack: A Governance Blueprint for Scalable) Tj
T*
(and Trusted AI*. Each layer is treated as a contract surface that binds risk controls,) Tj
T*
(cognitive safeguards, and affective constraints.) Tj
T*
T*
(## 4. Layer Interdependence and Power Geometry) Tj
T*
(Layer boundaries are permeable to guarantee system cohesion. Power geometry recognizes) Tj
T*
(that decision authority, data provenance, and execution logic concentrate differently) Tj
T*
(across layers. The stack addresses vertical power flow \(from infrastructure to user) Tj
T*
(interaction\) and horizontal influence \(across partner ecosystems\) to mitigate capture and) Tj
T*
(concentration risks. Persona Architecture anchors Layer 4 by establishing accountable) Tj
T*
(instruction sets, while AEIP operationalizes Layer 5 as the protocol spine that transmits) Tj
T*
(epistemic commitments. Governance artifacts at Layer 7 distribute power by exposing) Tj
T*
(stewardship evidence to external auditors and public stakeholders.) Tj
T*
T*
(## 5. Layer-by-Layer Framework) Tj
T*
(1. **Layer 0  Civic Mandate \(Optional\):** Establishes jurisdictional legitimacy and) Tj
T*
(social license. It captures legislative authorization, community compacts, and public) Tj
T*
(trust obligations.) Tj
T*
(2. **Layer 1  Physical and Compute Substrate:** Covers data centers, chip governance, and) Tj
T*
(reliability engineering aligned with ISO/IEC 27001 controls. Monitoring includes) Tj
T*
(resilience audits and energy accountability.) Tj
T*
(3. **Layer 2  Data Stewardship:** Ensures provenance, consent, and representational) Tj
T*
(justice. Epistemology by Design applies here through provenance ledgers and reasoning) Tj
T*
(lineage documentation.) Tj
T*
(4. **Layer 3  Model Development:** Governs training protocols, evaluation harnesses, and) Tj
T*
(red-teaming. Includes model cards, risk statements, and fairness reviews.) Tj
T*
(5. **Layer 4  Instruction and Control:** Persona Architecture delivers structured roles,) Tj
T*
(refusal logic, and affect management to ensure the AI acts within declared mandates.) Tj
T*
(6. **Layer 5  Reasoning Exchange and Interface:** AEIP enforces structured dialogue) Tj
T*
(between AI services, auditors, and human supervisors using signed reasoning packets and) Tj
T*
(integrity fingerprints.) Tj
T*
(7. **Layer 6  Deployment and Integration:** Covers runtime environments, incident) Tj
T*
(response, and change control across organizational ecosystems.) Tj
T*
(8. **Layer 7  Governance Publication:** Releases GDS packages, ILE updates, and public) Tj
T*
(accountability artifacts ensuring transparency, traceability, and trust.) Tj
T*
T*
(## 6. Governance Artifacts and Audit Infrastructure) Tj
T*
(The stack relies on reusable artifacts: Governance Disclosure Statements \(GDS\) synthesize) Tj
T*
(cross-layer obligations; Integrity Ledger Entries \(ILE\) notarize decisions and maturity) Tj
T*
(attestations; Oversight Action Memoranda \(OAM\) document interventions and remediations;) Tj

T*
(reconstruct evidentiary reasoning; and Decision Rationale Records \(DRR\) preserve) Tj
T*

T*
(in `tests/aeip_schema_validation.py`.) Tj
T*
T*
(## 7. Temporal Integrity and Semantic Version Control) Tj
T*
(Governance is inherently temporal. Every change to Persona Architecture configurations,) Tj
T*
(epistemic safeguards, or AEIP schemas requires semantic versioning anchored to custodial) Tj
T*
(review. Temporal integrity is sustained through synchronized clocks, validity windows for) Tj
T*
(each artifact, and automated drift alerts triggered by reasoning fingerprint deviation.) Tj
T*
(Semantic version control couples model updates with governance obligations to prevent) Tj
T*
(silent regression.) Tj
T*
T*
(## 8. Global Framework Interoperability Map) Tj
T*
(The stack crosswalks to prevailing frameworks: Layer 2 aligns with NIST AI RMF Data and) Tj
T*
(Data Governance; Layer 3 maps to ISO/IEC 42001 operational controls; Layer 4 satisfies EU) Tj
T*
(AI Act transparency and instruction mandates; Layer 5 implements TRUST Framework) Tj
T*
(interoperability principles. The interoperability map establishes translation guides so) Tj
T*
(that organizations can certify once and comply many times, minimizing audit friction while) Tj
T*
(preserving rigor.) Tj
T*
T*
(## 9. Adaptive Governance and Foresight) Tj
T*
(Adaptive governance assumes AI systems encounter dynamic contexts. Scenario planning,) Tj
T*
(foresight scanning, and socio-technical sensing are embedded at Layer 6 and Layer 7.) Tj
T*
(Persona Architecture supplies the adjustable knobs, AEIP carries foresight signals, and) Tj
T*
(Governance Councils interpret the signals to recalibrate controls. The stack mandates) Tj
T*
(quarterly foresight reviews incorporating emergent risks, policy shifts, and cultural) Tj
T*
(feedback loops.) Tj
T*
T*
(## 10. Implementation and Adoption Pathways) Tj
T*
(Organizations SHALL follow a staged adoption: inventory existing systems, map them to the) Tj
T*
(stack, implement Persona Architecture for instruction surfaces, deploy AEIP nodes, and) Tj
T*
(publish the first GDS. Sectoral extensionssuch as GERDY v1 for education or ARCHY v1 for) Tj
T*
(healthcareserve as reference templates. Adoption pathways emphasize co-design with) Tj
T*
(affected communities, aligning with the dignity-first ethos introduced in *Persona) Tj
T*
(Architecture*.) Tj
T*
T*
(## 11. Custodianship and Change Management) Tj
T*
(Custodianship rests with a designated Governance Council empowered to approve changes,) Tj
T*
(review audits, and steward public accountability. Change management integrates AEIP change) Tj
T*
(requests, DRR updates, and OAM tracking. Custodians SHALL maintain a change ledger, ensure) Tj
T*
(training for human overseers, and coordinate with regulators to synchronize compliance) Tj
T*
(submissions. Custodianship is designed to be portable across organizations while) Tj

(## 16. Human Dignity and Affective Constraint Module) Tj
T*
(Dignity operates as a non-negotiable constraint. Persona Architecture requires agents to) Tj
T*
(declare identity and intent at session initiation, ensuring clarity of role and) Tj
T*
(accountability. The module prohibits intimacy simulation, manipulative sentiment scripts,) Tj
