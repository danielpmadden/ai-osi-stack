# Code of Conduct

## Core Principles

- Lead with respect, transparency, and integrity in every interaction.
- Anchor all discussions to the civic mission and moral commitments of the AI OSI Stack.
- Be a good person. Treat every participant with dignity, empathy, and patience.

## Expected Behaviors

- Communicate honestly about intentions, limitations, and provenance of any proposed work.
- Cite canonical materials and credit the maintainer when referencing or teaching the Stack.
- Share only accurate, non-misleading information about the project and its governance posture.
- Uphold confidentiality requests made during security or integrity reviews.

## Unacceptable Behaviors

- Any action that undermines the Stack’s civic goals, moral commitments, or custodial integrity.
- Harassment, discrimination, or disrespectful conduct in public or private channels.
- Misrepresentation of affiliation or authorization to speak on behalf of the project.
- Attempts to coerce or pressure the maintainer into collaborations that conflict with the mission.

## Alignment and Collaboration

All collaboration must align with the project’s moral mission and civic goals. Prospective contributors should review [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) and initiate contact only if they can demonstrate shared values and ethical intent.

## Reporting

Report concerns, violations, or integrity issues via email to **44127480+danielpmadden@users.noreply.github.com** or by opening an issue tagged `governance-conduct` if it is safe to do so. Include relevant context, links, and timestamps so the custodian can respond effectively.

## Enforcement

The custodian reserves the right to remove access, decline collaboration, or take other appropriate actions to protect the project’s moral and civic commitments. Serious violations may be documented publicly to maintain transparency with the community.
