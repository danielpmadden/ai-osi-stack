# AI OSI Stack — Open-Core Civic Layer

**AI OSI Stack** is a civic governance and documentation framework authored and maintained by **Daniel P. Madden**. This public repository provides the open-core standards, schemas, exemplar ledgers, and validator-lite tools needed to understand and steward the Stack’s governance model.

- **Current Release:** `v5.0-open-core` *(pre-v5 governance lock)*
- **Next Release:** `v5.0` *(full canonical publication pending integrity review)*

The operational implementations—**Governance Control Tower™**, AEIP runtime services, ledger execution engines, analytics dashboards, and affiliated commercial tooling—remain proprietary. This repository focuses on transparency, civic legitimacy, and reproducible documentation.

## What’s Included

| Scope | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Civic governance standards, chapters, and briefs | ✅ Open-core | Markdown, LaTeX, and schema references defining the AI OSI Stack’s governance canon. |
| Schemas, ledgers, and exemplar artefacts | ✅ Open-core | Reference AEIP payloads, integrity notices, and provenance manifests for study and validation. |
| Validator-lite utilities | ✅ Open-core | `_open_tools/` scripts for schema linting, documentation synthesis, and integrity spot-checks. |
| Governance Control Tower™ runtime | ⛔ Private | Operational automation, orchestration services, and runtime governance bindings reside in private repositories. |
| AEIP runtime, ledger engines, analytics dashboards | ⛔ Private | Commercial offerings that implement enforcement, telemetry, and dashboards. |

## Stewardship Principles

- **Single authorship.** All materials are authored and curated by Daniel P. Madden; contributions occur only through explicit custodial channels.
- **Civic-first orientation.** The open-core set preserves civic legitimacy, contextual documentation, and verification pathways.
- **Clear IP boundary.** Proprietary runtimes and commercial services are out of scope; this repository documents standards, not implementations.
