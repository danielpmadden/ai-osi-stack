# AI OSI Stack — Changelog v5.1-open-core

## Overview

Release v5.1-open-core finalizes the public separation from the private
Governance Control Tower runtime. This increment focuses on structural clarity,
licensing transparency, and refreshed onboarding materials for civic audiences.

## Highlights

- Completed repository-wide audit confirming removal of private runtime assets
  and documenting residual references that require follow-up clean-up.
- Updated licensing notice to reflect Apache-2.0 (code) and CC BY-SA 4.0 (docs)
  split, aligning with provenance declarations.
- Refreshed provenance metadata to mark the v5.1-open-core milestone and provide
  clear version/date records.
- Produced a modernized README draft in `_staging/README_PROPOSED.md` tailored to
  civic, regulatory, and academic stakeholders.
- Hardened open validation helpers under `_open_tools/` with SPDX headers and
  functioning JSON/provenance checks suitable for public distribution.
