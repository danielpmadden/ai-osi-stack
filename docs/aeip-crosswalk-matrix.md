# AEIP Crosswalk Matrix — AEIP-Schema-1.0-2025-11

**Integrity Notice:** Version hash: TBD. Generated on 2025-05-09T00:00:00Z.

This matrix situates the AI Epistemic Infrastructure Protocol (AEIP) artifacts in relation to the AI OSI Stack, Persona Architecture controls, and Epistemology by Design (EbD) layers. The mappings reflect canonical guidance from The AI OSI Stack v4 (Expanded) and AEIP v1.

| AI OSI Layer | AEIP Artifact | Persona Architecture Control | EbD Epistemic Layer | Governance Function |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Layer 1 – Strategic Mandate | Integrity Ledger Entry (contextual GENESIS) | Persona Charter Ratification | Epistemic Foundations | Establishes institutional mandate and identity commitments |
| Layer 2 – Ethical Positioning | Integrity Ledger Entry (policy anchoring) | Persona Values Codex | Epistemic Commitments | Records binding ethical axioms and boundary conditions |
| Layer 3 – Interpretability & Transparency | Interpretive Trace Package | Persona Evidence Interface | Epistemic Observation | Captures interpretive evidence for model comprehension |
| Layer 4 – Governance Decision Authority | Decision Rationale Record | Persona Deliberation Protocol | Epistemic Deliberation | Documents multi-party reasoning and adjudication |
| Layer 5 – Operationalization & Change Management | Governance Decision Summary | Persona Deployment Dossier | Epistemic Translation | Communicates actionable decisions to operational teams |
| Layer 6 – Oversight & Assurance | Oversight Audit Memo | Persona Assurance Circuit | Epistemic Validation | Records assurance findings and remediation directives |
| Layer 7 – Integrity & Continuity | Integrity Ledger Entry | Persona Continuity Register | Epistemic Memory | Notarizes temporal integrity and lifecycle events |

## Usage Guidance

- **Bidirectional Traceability:** Each AEIP artifact SHALL reference controlling Persona Architecture elements and EbD epistemic checkpoints to maintain evidentiary coherence.
- **Temporal Integrity:** Integrity Ledger Entries SHALL sequence every artifact transition, providing verifiable chains for cross-layer governance.
- **Ethical Safeguards:** Oversight Audit Memos SHALL evaluate adherence to Persona Values Codex commitments recorded at Layers 1–2, ensuring ethical invariants remain intact.
