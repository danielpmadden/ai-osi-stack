# AEIP v1 Specification (Superseded)

**Status:** This document is retained for archival purposes. The canonical specification is now [AEIP v1.3 — AI Epistemic Infrastructure Protocol](AEIP_Spec_v1_3.md), which replaces all requirements and guidance previously captured here.

Historic references may consult the prior version via repository history, but new implementations MUST follow AEIP v1.3.
