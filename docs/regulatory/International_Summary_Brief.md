# AI OSI Stack v5 — International Summary Brief

## 1. Purpose and Scope
This brief provides a neutral, UN-style overview of the AI OSI Stack custodial specification for international partners.
It summarises governance structures, oversight expectations, and the non-operational nature of released artefacts.

## 2. Governance Architecture
- The Stack comprises layered controls from civic mandate through strategic resilience, mapped to verification artefacts in `reference/`.
- Custodial stewards maintain provenance manifests and issue public updates via `versions/`.
- Operational tooling remains private; released materials focus on governance design, verification evidence, and regulatory alignment.

## 3. Oversight Practices
- Directors and regulators are supported with curated briefings (`README_For_Directors.md`) and mapping tables referencing global board oversight, listed governance, and public risk disclosure frameworks.
- Incident management, disclosure routines, and risk inventory templates are harmonised across jurisdiction-neutral formats.
- Custodial updates require checksum validation and manifest publication to ensure tamper-evident releases.

## 4. International Reuse and Alignment
- Materials are licenced under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0; translations and commentary are encouraged with attribution and without derivative modifications.
- Jurisdictions can align their oversight processes by referencing layer-specific clauses and adapting verification checklists to domestic regulators.
- Cross-border collaborations should coordinate checksum manifests and governance updates through shared custodial registries to preserve trust.

## 5. Next Actions for Partners
- Review `meta/v5-manifest.yaml` for canonical identifiers, checksum parameters, and update cadence.
- Engage with the Custodial Editorial Committee to schedule bilateral walkthroughs or multilateral workshops.
- Track forthcoming translations (e.g., `International_Summary_Brief_fr.md`) for local-language onboarding.
