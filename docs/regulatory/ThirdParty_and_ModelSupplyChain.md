## Due Diligence Questionnaire (Non-Technical)
1. Describe your security governance program and certifications relevant to AI services.
2. Provide details on training data sources, licensing rights, and data minimization practices.
3. Outline privacy safeguards and compliance with applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
4. Share model evaluation results, including bias mitigation steps and robustness testing.
5. Explain your incident response process, notification timelines, and prior incident history.
6. Identify subcontractors or downstream providers supporting your AI service.
7. Detail model update cadence and communication protocol for significant changes.
8. Provide assurances regarding intellectual property ownership and indemnification.
9. Confirm existence of data processing agreements (DPAs) and audit rights provisions.
10. Describe your approach to prompt injection defenses, misuse monitoring, and access controls.

## Contract Guardrails
- Clear usage boundaries restricting data inputs and prohibited use cases.
- Service level agreements defining uptime, response times, and remediation commitments.
- Audit and assessment rights enabling on-site or documentary reviews.
- Indemnity clauses covering data breaches, IP infringement, and regulatory penalties.
- Mandatory incident notification windows aligned with public risk disclosure timelines.
- Requirements for vendor participation in joint tabletop exercises and risk assessments.
- Termination clauses triggered by material non-compliance or sustained control failures.

## Monitoring Cadence & Termination Criteria
- Quarterly vendor risk reviews covering performance metrics, incident reports, and control attestations.
- Annual reassessment of data rights, model evaluations, and contractual compliance.
- Continuous monitoring for adverse media, regulatory actions, or security advisories.
- Terminate or suspend vendors for unresolved high-severity findings, repeated SLA breaches, or refusal to cooperate with oversight activities.

## Shadow AI Policy Statement
- Unauthorized use of external AI tools without procurement and governance review is prohibited.
- Employees must route AI tool requests through the AI Risk Council for evaluation against control requirements documented in this repository.
- Violations trigger disciplinary action, incident reporting, and potential disclosure considerations if data exposure occurs.
- Training sessions emphasize recognition of shadow AI risks and highlight approved alternatives.
