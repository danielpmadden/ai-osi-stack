# Design Principles

- **Layer/Theme:** Governance Philosophy & Non-Goals
- **Version:** v5.0-rc
- **Source Reference:** `design_principles`
- **Last Generated:** 2025-11-10T00:00:49Z

## Binding Principles
1. **Dignity by Design:** Every layer SHALL uphold human dignity, epistemic integrity, and accountable stewardship. Violations MUST be escalated through [Layer 6 – Deployment & Integration](./10_Layer_6_Deployment_Integration.md) incident response procedures.
2. **Design Now, Instantiate Later:** The repository operates as an offline-first rehearsal environment. Teams SHOULD rehearse governance artefacts using deterministic schemas, hashes, and provenance scripts before production rollout.
3. **Transparency with Proof:** Each obligation SHALL map to AEIP artefacts so auditors can trace decisions. Use [Testing Framework](./19_Testing_Framework.md) guidance to validate this mapping.

## Non-Goals
- **No Live Services:** The Stack SHALL NOT ship production keys or authoritative signatures until the deferred signing ceremony completes.
- **No Real Personal Data:** All data and personas SHOULD remain synthetic for demonstration purposes, avoiding privacy exposures.
- **Advisory Only:** Documentation offers governance blueprints but SHALL NOT replace jurisdiction-specific legal counsel. Refer legal questions to qualified advisors.

## Implementation Implications
Implementers SHALL configure pipelines that generate hashes, manifest diffs, and ledger entries automatically. This ensures [Technology Base](./15_Technology_Base.md) assets remain auditable, and cross-layer dependencies are enforced via AEIP validators.
