    "summary": "The AI OSI Stack is an open-standard governance blueprint that translates civic intent and ethical mandates into a layered architecture so every stage of an AI system carries duties, evidence records, and safeguards, mirroring the networking OSI model to keep deployments auditable and trustworthy.",
    "problem_solved": "It replaces fragmented AI oversight—disconnected model cards, privacy reviews, and ad hoc boards—with a reproducible governance spine that binds social mandates to operational controls and machine-verifiable artefacts so institutions can prove what an AI system did, why, and under whose authority.",
    "osi_analogy": "Like the networking OSI model, the Stack sequences layers from Civic Mandate through Civic Participation (0–8), with each layer exposing defined interfaces and artefacts that hand off responsibilities and evidence to the next, while AEIP functions like the protocol suite transporting proofs across the stack."
