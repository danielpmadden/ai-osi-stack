# Context

This release introduces the AI OSI Stack Governance Control Tower (v5.0-MVP). The dashboard provides civic stewards with a shared operational picture across eight governance layers, simulated AEIP handshakes, and a lightweight ledger console. Placeholder FastAPI routes supply JSON while the frontend can gracefully fall back to embedded datasets when the network is unreachable.
