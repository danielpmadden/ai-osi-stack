# AI OSI Stack Overview

- **Layer/Theme:** Core Identity & Roadmap
- **Version:** v5.0-rc
- **Source Reference:** `core_identity`, `future_vision`

## Executive Summary
The AI OSI Stack is an open-standard governance spine that translates civic mandates into actionable duties across nine interconnected layers. It SHALL ensure that every artefact generated by an AI program is backed by democratic legitimacy, enforceable obligations, and machine-verifiable evidence. This overview SHOULD be consulted before engaging any layer-specific specification.

## Problem Statement
Fragmented oversight regimes leave AI deployments without cohesive accountability. The Stack replaces isolated model cards, privacy reviews, and ad hoc boards with a reproducible framework binding social directives to operational controls and cryptographic provenance. Implementers SHALL use this reference to explain why their deployment exists, who authorized it, and how evidence is transported across the stack.

## OSI Analogy
Mirroring the networking OSI model, the Stack sequences duties from Layer 0 Civic Mandate through Layer 8 Civic Participation. Each layer exposes defined interfaces and produces artefacts that the AEIP protocol ferries between participants. Cross-layer dependencies SHALL be honored in accordance with the layer documents, e.g., Layer 3 Model Development relies on artefacts curated in [Layer 2 – Data Stewardship](./06_Layer_2_Data_Stewardship.md).

## Roadmap Snapshot
The v5.0-rc release focuses on launching a managed Verification API, delivering finance and healthcare pilots, establishing a governance federation, and executing the deferred-signing ceremony. Governance teams SHOULD register roadmap updates through Integrity Ledger Entries and Governance Decision Summaries so downstream readers can track evolution against civic commitments.

## Usage Guidance
- Read [Context](./01_Context.md) to expand on the societal problem and networking analogy.
- Follow layer documents in numerical order to preserve dependency integrity.
- Reference [Roadmap](./22_Roadmap.md) for forward-looking commitments.
