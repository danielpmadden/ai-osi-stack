## Purpose
Layer 8 maintains participatory feedback, appeal mechanisms, and renewal processes with affected communities. It SHALL safeguard civic legitimacy by ensuring public input influences ongoing operations.

## Core Functions
- Host participatory forums and appeal channels referencing [Layer 7 – Governance Publication](./11_Layer_7_Governance_Publication.md).
- Capture renewal directives that cycle back into [Layer 0 – Civic Mandate](./04_Layer_0_Civic_Mandate.md).
- Report sentiment and feedback metrics to [Layer 6 – Deployment & Integration](./10_Layer_6_Deployment_Integration.md).

## Dependencies
This layer draws on published artefacts and feeds renewal directives upstream. AEIP SHALL certify that civic feedback was acknowledged before mandates renew.

## Required Artefacts
- **Participation Record Ledger:** MUST catalog events, attendees, and recommendations.
- **Appeals Resolution Log:** SHALL document cases, outcomes, and remediation timelines.
- **Renewal Directive Packet:** SHOULD summarize consensus inputs driving mandate updates.

## Governance Controls
- Civic participation sessions SHALL be scheduled in alignment with charter review cycles.
- Renewal directives SHOULD be hashed and linked to Governance Decision Summaries for auditability.
