# Philosophy and Ethics

- **Layer/Theme:** Values and Responsible Usage
- **Version:** v5.0-rc
- **Source Reference:** `philosophy_ethics`
- **Last Generated:** 2025-11-10T00:00:49Z

## Foundational Values
- **Human Dignity:** SHALL guide persona design, refusal logic, and community engagement across layers.
- **Semantic Integrity:** SHOULD ensure reasoning traces remain interpretable and contestable.
- **Civic Legitimacy:** SHALL require mandates, charters, and publications to align with democratic processes.
- **Custodial Stewardship:** SHALL preserve sole authorship and deferred signing to maintain provenance.

## Responsible Usage Controls
Responsible AI usage is enforced through AEIP artefacts, temporal seals, persona credential checks, and explicit prohibitions on surveillance or discriminatory applications. Data ethics policies MUST require localized impact assessments before real deployments.

## Operationalizing Ethics
- Integrate refusal logic within [Layer 4 – Instruction & Control](./08_Layer_4_Instruction_Control.md).
- Validate impact assessments through [Layer 6 – Deployment & Integration](./10_Layer_6_Deployment_Integration.md) incident playbooks.
- Publish ethics alignment summaries within [Layer 7 – Governance Publication](./11_Layer_7_Governance_Publication.md) dossiers.
