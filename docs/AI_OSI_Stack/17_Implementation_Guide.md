# Implementation Guide

- **Layer/Theme:** Governance Flow & AEIP Validation
- **Version:** v5.0-rc
- **Source Reference:** `core_identity`, `layer_structure`, `philosophy_ethics`
- **Last Generated:** 2025-11-10T00:00:49Z

## Deployment Phases
1. **Mandate Establishment:** Gather civic approvals per [Layer 0](./04_Layer_0_Civic_Mandate.md) and encode obligations into [Layer 1](./05_Layer_1_Ethical_Charter.md).
2. **Asset Preparation:** Steward data via [Layer 2](./06_Layer_2_Data_Stewardship.md) and develop models under [Layer 3](./07_Layer_3_Model_Development.md).
3. **Runtime Enablement:** Configure instructions in [Layer 4](./08_Layer_4_Instruction_Control.md) and reasoning exchanges in [Layer 5](./09_Layer_5_Reasoning_Exchange.md).
4. **Operational Control:** Manage releases through [Layer 6](./10_Layer_6_Deployment_Integration.md), publish evidence in [Layer 7](./11_Layer_7_Governance_Publication.md), and capture feedback in [Layer 8](./12_Layer_8_Civic_Participation.md).

## AEIP Validation Paths

  participant Mandate as L0 Mandate

  participant Control as L4 Control
  participant Reason as L5 Reasoning
  participant Deploy as L6 Deployment
  participant Publish as L7 Publication
  participant Civic as L8 Civic

  Civic->>Mandate: Renewal Directive
```
Each transition SHALL be logged with AEIP receipts, hashed, and stored in the Integrity Ledger. Validation scripts SHOULD block progress when obligations lack supporting artefacts.

## Governance Flow Checklist
- Configure CI pipelines to run schema validation and produce Governance Decision Summaries.
- Maintain a registry of deferred-signing artefacts awaiting sealing ceremonies.
- Schedule civic participation reviews ahead of roadmap milestones in [Roadmap](./22_Roadmap.md).
