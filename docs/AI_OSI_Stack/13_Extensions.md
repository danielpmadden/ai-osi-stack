# Stack Extensions and Interpretive Canon

## Optional Layers
The protocol spec flags certain components—particularly Policy / Layer 8—for optional adoption in constrained deployments. Independent Custodians SHALL document rationale when omitting civic participation and SHOULD define compensating controls referencing [Layer 7 – Governance Publication](./11_Layer_7_Governance_Publication.md).

## Interpretive & Applied Canon (19A–24)
These chapters extend semantics, persona design, therapy governance, and meta-oversight. They SHOULD be treated as advisory modules enhancing the core nine-layer stack.

### Recommended Adoption
- Deploy interpretive canon guidance when personas require cultural or therapeutic alignment.
- Engage optional layers during early pilots to prevent governance debt and to prepare for full civic overlays.

## Integration Guidance
- Optional modules SHALL still bind to AEIP obligations; omission MUST be recorded in the Integrity Ledger.
- When optional layers become mandatory, teams SHOULD regenerate the [Crosswalk Index](./25_Crosswalk_Index.md) to track new JSON references.
