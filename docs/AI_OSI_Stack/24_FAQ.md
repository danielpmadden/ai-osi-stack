## Why does each layer exist?
- **Layer 0 – Civic Mandate:** Provides democratic authorization for the entire stack.
- **Layer 1 – Ethical Charter:** Converts values into enforceable obligations.
- **Layer 2 – Data Stewardship:** Ensures data provenance and consent compliance.
- **Layer 3 – Model Development:** Documents lineage and evaluations.
- **Layer 4 – Instruction & Control:** Governs runtime prompts and intents.
- **Layer 5 – Reasoning Exchange:** Executes AEIP handshakes and signatures.
- **Layer 6 – Deployment & Integration:** Manages releases, monitoring, and incidents.
- **Layer 7 – Governance Publication:** Shares evidence externally.
- **Layer 8 – Civic Participation:** Captures community feedback and renewals.

## How is accountability proven?
AEIP artefacts MUST accompany each decision, with Integrity Ledger entries linking mandates, charters, data consent, model evaluations, and public disclosures. Refer to [Implementation Guide](./17_Implementation_Guide.md) for validation paths.

## What examples illustrate the stack in action?
Use AEIP validator notebooks, Control Tower dashboards, and sector pilots in finance, healthcare, and public-sector oversight to demonstrate adoption, as described in [Governance Publication Process](./21_Governance_Publication.md).

## How should documentation be written?
Documentation SHALL maintain a plain-technical voice with normative SHALL/SHOULD clauses and cross-links, per [Design Principles](./03_Design_Principles.md).
