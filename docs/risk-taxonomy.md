# AI OSI Stack — Condensed Risk Taxonomy
**Author:** Daniel P. Madden  
**Version:** v5 – Ready for Publication Sealing  
**Date:** November 2025

> ## Normative Language Notice
> This document uses normative language consistent with ISO/IEC 42010 and NIST conventions.  
> “SHALL” denotes mandatory requirements, “SHOULD” denotes strong recommendations, and “MAY” denotes optional practices.  
> Interpretations SHALL preserve authorial intent: layered accountability, epistemic integrity, and human dignity as binding design constraints.

## 1. Layer 1 — Physical and Compute Substrate
- **Risk Themes:** Hardware tampering, supply chain disruption, resilience degradation.  
- **Sentinel Indicators:** Facility access anomalies, unscheduled firmware changes, energy draw deviations.  
- **Primary Controls:** Certified facility audits, redundant energy governance, tamper-evident custody logs.  
- **Required Evidence:** GDS section L1, DRR infrastructure appendix, ILE temporal seals for facility inspections.

## 2. Layer 2 — Data Stewardship
- **Risk Themes:** Data poisoning, consent erosion, epistemic contamination.  
- **Sentinel Indicators:** Provenance gaps, unexplained distribution shifts, contested consent revocations.  
- **Primary Controls:** Consent traceability ledgers, dataset review boards, epistemic hygiene playbooks.  
- **Required Evidence:** ITP provenance bundles, DRR data stewardship summaries, AEIP lineage signatures.

## 3. Layer 3 — Model Development
- **Risk Themes:** Bias amplification, evaluation blind spots, adversarial regressions.  
- **Sentinel Indicators:** Diverging fairness metrics, untested safety scenarios, failed regression thresholds.  
- **Primary Controls:** Composite evaluation harnesses, adversarial benchmarking cadences, persona-aligned regression suites.  
- **Required Evidence:** OAM evaluation actions, GDS validation annex, DRR design decisions.

## 4. Layer 4 — Instruction and Control
- **Risk Themes:** Prompt injection, persona drift, affect misalignment, refusal degradation.  
- **Sentinel Indicators:** Persona mismatch alerts, refusal override logs, affect boundary excursions.  
- **Primary Controls:** Persona mandate enforcement, refusal logic penetration testing, affect boundary audits.  
- **Required Evidence:** ITP instruction traces, DRR persona matrices, GDS instruction governance statements.

## 5. Layer 5 — Reasoning Exchange and Interface
- **Risk Themes:** Ledger desynchronization, packet replay, counter-signature gaps, handshake tampering.  
- **Sentinel Indicators:** Hash mismatches, delayed acknowledgements, anomalous replay counts.  
- **Primary Controls:** AEIP handshake validation, deterministic replay checkpoints, cross-node quorum review.  
- **Required Evidence:** ILE handshake bundles, OAM remediation logs, AEIP transcript archives.

## 6. Layer 6 — Deployment and Integration
- **Risk Themes:** Runtime drift, integration conflicts, incident opacity.  
- **Sentinel Indicators:** Unauthorized configuration changes, failed deployment gates, unreported incidents.  
- **Primary Controls:** Change gating with governance approvals, blue/green stewardship protocols, incident rehearsal cadences.  
- **Required Evidence:** TRR release attestations, OAM incident records, ILE change approvals.

## 7. Layer 7 — Governance Publication
- **Risk Themes:** Delayed disclosure, accountability gaps, legitimacy erosion.  
- **Sentinel Indicators:** Missed publication cadences, stakeholder complaints, inconsistent disclosure metadata.  
- **Primary Controls:** Public disclosure schedules, multi-stakeholder review councils, archival notarization.  
- **Required Evidence:** GDS transparency packs, ILE publication proofs, custodial meeting minutes.

## 8. Cross-Cutting Dynamics
- **Temporal Integrity:** Validity windows SHALL be enforced with temporal seals and quarterly audits.  
- **Custodianship:** Governance councils SHALL document every change request, remediation, and escalation in AEIP-compatible ledgers.  
- **Human Dignity:** Affective constraint modules SHALL be monitored for erosion; violations trigger immediate OAM issuance and persona retraining.
