# Civic Nerve Net Brief

## Summary
The Civic Nerve Net frames the AI OSI Stack as a distributed nervous system in which AEIP envelopes act as signals, layers provide reflex arcs, and governance artefacts anchor civic intent. Layer obligations recorded in `reference/AI_OSI_Stack_v5_Core.md` establish the vertical pathways that Heartwood coordinates for instruction and reasoning loops, while the Civic Charter secures the sensory receptors of civic legitimacy and rights. The Heartwood Core Specification adds the synaptic logic that keeps Layer 04 and Layer 05 aligned with persona duties, ensuring that every signal entering the system carries clause IDs and timestamps for traceability.

## Signal Pathways
- **Sensory Intake:** Civic assemblies and participation clauses (Clauses L08-C001 to L08-C003) surface community impulses that initiate AEIP broadcasts documented in the clause index.  
- **Processing Core:** Instruction controls and reasoning exchanges (Clauses L04-C001 to L05-C003) translate civic signals into actionable safeguards managed by Heartwood.  
- **Motor Response:** Deployment, publication, and resilience layers (Clauses L06-C001 through L12-C003) propagate validated actions back to civic partners via ledger-backed attestations.
