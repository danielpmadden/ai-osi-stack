# Custodial Vascularity Brief

## Summary
Custodial Vascularity treats integrity assets as the circulatory system that sustains civic trust. The sealed ledger, manifest checksums, and provenance statements form arteries that carry authenticated hashes, while AEIP schema requirements ensure that every message transports validated metadata. Clause-aligned transparency duties and the Heartwood ledger sync guarantee that governance artefacts continuously pump verified information across institutions.

## Circulation Map
- **Arterial Flows:** `meta/v5-manifest.yaml` enumerates canonical documents whose SHA-512 hashes now populate `audits/Integrity_Ledger.md`, providing the oxygenated flow of trust.
- **Capillary Exchange:** Clauses such as L00-C002, L06-C002, and L07-C002 require transparency notices that distribute ledger-anchored disclosures into civic channels.
- **Return Pathways:** The Integrity Validation Report and Integrity Notice function as venous pathways that return verification results to maintainers, reinforcing the duty to reseal hashes after each change.
