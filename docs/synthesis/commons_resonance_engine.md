# Commons Resonance Engine Brief

## Summary
The Commons Resonance Engine describes how civic mandates, AEIP specifications, and governance narratives harmonize to produce institutional trust. Layer clauses deliver the oscillating civic frequencies, while the Governance Manifest and Civic Charter provide resonance chambers that translate those frequencies into actionable commitments. AEIP schema checkpoints and Heartwood orchestration ensure each resonance is logged, replayable, and auditable across civic and commercial boundaries.

## Resonance Components
- **Frequency Sources:** Clause families across Layers 00–12 encode civic expectations, embedding AEIP pointers that dictate how messages must be constructed and routed.
- **Amplification Chambers:** `governance/Governance_Manifest.md` and `governance/Civic_Charter.md` reference clause IDs to contextualize rights, duties, and AEIP obligations for public oversight bodies.
- **Control Oscillators:** `meta/AEIP_Specification.md` and the Heartwood Core mediate how instructions and reasoning cycles stay in tune with civic mandates, while the Integrity Ledger preserves historical resonance for future audits.
