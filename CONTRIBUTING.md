# Contributing to the AI OSI Stack

The AI OSI Stack is a civic commons project. Contributions are welcome from public servants, community stewards, researchers, and technologists who support transparent, accountable AI governance.

## Principles

- **Civic alignment.** Proposals must reinforce public interest goals and uphold the design principles in `foundation/design_principles.md`.
- **Open documentation.** All substantive changes require plain-language summaries, rationale, and references to supporting evidence.
- **Non-commercial intent.** Contributions must avoid monetization, proprietary lock-in, or cryptographic payloads.

## Ways to Contribute

1. **Issue reports.** Use GitHub issues to flag gaps, propose improvements, or document local adaptations.
2. **Pull requests.** Submit focused PRs with clear summaries, updated links, and changelog entries when relevant.
3. **Community feedback.** Share civic deliberation notes, participation metrics, or testing outcomes in discussions or reference documents.

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- [ ] Reference impacted documents and update cross-links.
- [ ] Include public rationale in the PR description and update `CHANGELOG.md` for notable releases.
- [ ] Confirm that new or modified files use lowercase names without numeric prefixes.

## Review Process

Maintainers review contributions for civic impact, clarity, and adherence to licensing. Expect collaborative feedback and requests for additional documentation. Decisions are recorded transparently to maintain public trust.
