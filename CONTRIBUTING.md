# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in the AI OSI Stack. This repository remains a canonical civic governance artifact, stewarded carefully to preserve its intent and integrity.

## Foundational Expectations

- **No pull requests to `main` will be accepted.** The canonical branch is closed to public contribution to protect provenance, accuracy, and moral posture.
- **Forks are permitted strictly for personal study or educational exploration.** Public redistribution, commercialization, or derivative governance frameworks are not authorized.
- **Before any collaborative work is considered, contact the maintainer directly at 44127480+danielpmadden@users.noreply.github.com.** Prospective partners must demonstrate alignment with the Stack’s moral and civic mission and agree to uphold its custodial norms.

Copying or modifying this work blindly, or using it for harmful, exploitative, or unethical purposes, is strictly discouraged and morally condemned.

## Working in Alignment

1. Review [`LICENSE`](LICENSE), [`DISCLAIMER.md`](DISCLAIMER.md), and [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to confirm acceptance of the custodial, non-commercial terms.
2. If a values-aligned collaboration is approved, operate from a dedicated fork and coordinate milestones directly with the maintainer.
3. Preserve integrity artefacts, including `CANONICAL_PROVENANCE.yaml` and `INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md`, when referencing or replicating canonical materials.
4. Treat all operational scripts, audits, and schemas as reference implementations; do not rebrand them without explicit consent.

## Responsible Use

- Cite the project using [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff) when referencing the Stack in research, media, or policy work.
- Respect security guidance in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) and report vulnerabilities through the documented channels.
- Honor the advisory and integrity workflows by keeping local notes of any experiments and clearly distinguishing non-canonical derivatives.

## Civic Mission Reminder

The AI OSI Stack exists to enable accountable, transparent, and civically grounded AI governance. All conversations, experiments, and knowledge transfers should reinforce—never erode—those commitments.

The owner retains full credit and custodial authority over the canonical AI OSI Stack.
