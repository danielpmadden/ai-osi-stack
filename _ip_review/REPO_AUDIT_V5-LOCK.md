# REPO_AUDIT_V5-LOCK — Custodial Validation Summary

## Scope
- Full repository sweep covering Markdown, LaTeX, YAML, JSON/JSON-LD, and manifest artefacts.
- Focus on removing residual references to proprietary workspaces and reinforcing authorship and provenance protections for v5.0-open-core.

## Methodology
- Validated `.gitignore` to confirm exclusion of private directories (`analytics/`, `backend/`, `govspine/`, `protocol/`, `ml/`, `ops/`, `tools/`, `tests/`, `commercial/`, `briefing/`).
- Inspected tree for `.env`, `.pem`, or other credential artefacts; none detected.
- Inserted custodial headers across all Markdown and LaTeX sources reiterating © 2025 Daniel P. Madden authorship and the v5.0-open-core custodial edition.
- Updated `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and `LEGAL/` memoranda with the canonical custodial statement and refreshed IP boundary language disavowing unauthorized forks.
- Replaced provenance metadata in `CANONICAL_PROVENANCE.yaml` with the custodial lock values and generated `meta/v5-open-core-sha512-manifest.txt` for civic directories.
- Authored legal supplements (`LEGAL/DISCLAIMER-OF-AUTHORSHIP-AND-FORKS.md`, `LEGAL/VALIDATION-NOTICE.md`) and audit changelog `CHANGELOG_v5.0-open-core-AUDIT.md` to document the lock-in event.

## Integrity & Validation Results
- `_open_tools/validate_json.py` — ✓ All JSON and JSON-LD parsed without syntax errors.
- `_open_tools/integrity-check.py` — ✓ No private runtime directories detected inside the open-core tree.
- `_open_tools/version-check.py` — ✓ Canonical open-core version registered as `AI OSI Stack v5.0-open-core`.
- `meta/v5-open-core-sha512-manifest.txt` captures SHA-512 fingerprints for civic directories (`audits`, `docs`, `examples`, `ledger`, `legal`, `LEGAL`, `meta`, `_ip_review`, `_open_tools`, `press-kit`, `schemas`, `source`, `versions`, `archive`).

## Findings
- No hidden credentials, runtime binaries, or proprietary imports remain in the repository.
- Historical references to private workspaces persist only inside archived audits for contextual purposes and are clearly denoted as non-canonical.
- Custodial statements now open every civic manuscript, ensuring derivative works cannot omit authorship attribution without visibly altering files.
- Legal memoranda explicitly reject unauthorized forks as custodial derivatives and direct readers to `CANONICAL_PROVENANCE.yaml` for verification.

## Conclusion
The AI OSI Stack v5.0-open-core repository remains the sole canonical civic release. Custodial defenses now guard against unofficial mirrors, and integrity tooling confirms the tree’s compliance with open-core boundaries without changing the version tag.
