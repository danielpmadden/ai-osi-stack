# Authorship Verification Report

## Objective
Confirm that every Markdown and LaTeX artifact in the repository begins with the mandated custodial header and that no residual terminology (the retired collaborator/entity terminology) persists.

## Methodology
1. Enumerated all `.md`, `.markdown`, and `.tex` files.
2. Validated the first two lines to ensure the custodial header block appears verbatim (comment-prefixed for LaTeX sources).
3. Executed repository-wide string audits to confirm the removal of the prohibited terminology.

## Findings
- ✅ **Header Compliance:** 100% of Markdown and LaTeX files begin with the required custodial header.
- ✅ **Terminology Sweep:** No instances of the retired collaborator/entity terminology remain within textual sources; replacements align with “Custodial Author” / “Independent Custodian” terminology.
- ✅ **Custodial Notices:** Key legal memoranda reinforce the unauthorized status of forks and derivatives, including explicit “not authorized or endorsed” language.

## Evidence Snapshots
- Automated header verification script returned no exceptions (see audit log output retained in this report’s working notes).
- Repository search confirms zero matches for the deprecated terminology after replacement operations.

## Conclusion
Authorship metadata now fully conforms to the v5.0-open-core custodial standard. No corrective follow-up is required.
