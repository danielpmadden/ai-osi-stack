# Validation Notice

All official AI OSI Stack™ (v5.0-open-core) releases are validated against the provenance terms recorded in `CANONICAL_PROVENANCE.yaml`. The custodial lock applied on 2025-11-09 affirms that this repository alone constitutes the civic standard distribution.

Validation entails:

- Confirming the repository commit history aligns with `_ip_review/` audit trails.
- Verifying integrity artifacts (`meta/v5-open-core-sha512-manifest.txt`, `meta/v5-manifest.yaml`) against published hashes.
- Ensuring that LICENSE, NOTICE, and legal memoranda retain their custodial statements and reference the same canonical version string.

Any release lacking these validation markers is not recognized as an official custodial artifact. Stakeholders should reject binaries, PDFs, or archives that omit or alter the custodial statements contained here.

For assurance, consult `_ip_review/REPO_AUDIT_V5-LOCK.md` and the changelog `CHANGELOG_v5.0-open-core-AUDIT.md` accompanying this audit. Discrepancies or suspected tampering must be reported directly to the author through the contact guidance referenced in `legal/README.md` or via the civic governance channels described throughout `docs/`.
