# Design Principles

## Rick Adams Philosophy

- **Clarity.** Each requirement SHALL be written in plain language, with examples where necessary.
- **Sufficiency.** The stack states only what communities need to make informed decisions, avoiding speculative features.
- **Humility.** Layers SHALL acknowledge uncertainty and invite critique rather than asserting false certainty.
- **Reproducibility.** Evidence and reasoning SHOULD be documented so independent reviewers can replicate findings.

## Civic Stewardship Norms

1. **Mandate First.** Decisions SHALL trace back to the civic mandate before resource allocation or deployment.
2. **Ethics Everywhere.** Ethical commitments SHALL appear in every layer, not only in codes of conduct.
3. **Data Care.** Communities SHALL minimize data collection and ensure consent is informed, revocable, and honored.
4. **Iterative Validation.** Testing SHOULD occur at multiple layers, using open methods described in [../guides/testing_framework.md](../guides/testing_framework.md).
5. **Public Accountability.** Reports, deliberations, and remediation steps SHALL be recorded through the Civic Oversight Interface.
6. **Inclusive Participation.** Layer custodians SHALL design participation mechanisms that support access needs and language diversity.
7. **Temporal Awareness.** Decisions SHOULD include review dates, allowing communities to revisit assumptions over time.

## Implementation Guidance

- Templates SHOULD reference the Open Evidence Interface rather than proprietary services.
- Diagrams, if used, SHALL be shared as open formats and accompanied by textual descriptions for accessibility.
- Historical artifacts MAY be referenced for learning, but they SHALL be contextualized to avoid reinstating monetized controls.

## Measuring Success

Success is measured not by product velocity but by civic trust. Communities SHOULD evaluate:

- Whether people understand the mandate and how to engage.
- Whether documentation is accessible in multiple formats.
- Whether grievances result in timely, documented remediation.
- Whether the stack remains adaptable to new contexts without sacrificing public commitments.
