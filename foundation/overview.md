# Overview

The AI OSI Stack is a civic operating system for intelligence stewardship. It exists to help public institutions, community networks, and independent researchers work with artificial intelligence in a transparent, accountable, and educational manner.

## Civic Commitments

- **No proprietary code, no monetization, no cryptographic payloads.** Every layer is written for public interest use and may be adopted without licensing fees or vendor lock-in.
- **Open Evidence Interface (OEI).** Evidence exchange happens through public, inspectable documentation rather than commercial APIs or closed dashboards.
- **Rick Adams design philosophy.** The stack is shaped by clarity, sufficiency, humility, and reproducibility. Each layer states only what is necessary, invites verification, and encourages shared learning.

## Nine-Layer Civic Feedback Loop

The stack adapts the classical OSI model to social intelligence governance. Each layer is interdependent and may be reviewed individually or as part of a whole-system audit.

1. [L0 Civic Mandate](../layers/civic_mandate.md): Defines public purpose, scope, and mandate.
2. [L1 Ethical Charter](../layers/ethical_charter.md): Establishes duties, safeguards, and red lines.
3. [L2 Data Stewardship](../layers/data_stewardship.md): Guides sourcing, consent, and data minimization.
4. [L3 Model Development](../layers/model_development.md): Documents research practices and validation steps.
5. [L4 Instruction Control](../layers/instruction_control.md): Sets guardrails for prompts, feedback, and interpretability.
6. [L5 Reasoning Exchange](../layers/reasoning_exchange.md): Describes how insights move between humans and systems.
7. [L6 Deployment Integration](../layers/deployment_integration.md): Aligns civic infrastructure and operational readiness.
8. [L7 Governance Publication](../layers/governance_publication.md): Details public reporting and transparency cycles.
9. [L8 Civic Participation](../layers/civic_participation.md): Ensures community voice, grievance handling, and iteration.

These layers form a repeating loop: mandates drive ethical commitments, which inform data practices, model craft, instructional controls, reasoning exchange, deployment, publication, and participation. Feedback from communities feeds back into the mandate, ensuring continuous civic stewardship.

## How to Use this Edition

1. Start with the foundational materials in this directory to understand context, terms, and design principles.
2. Review each layer in order, taking note of required declarations and example civic practices.
3. Apply the guides in [../guides/implementation_guide.md](../guides/implementation_guide.md), [../guides/testing_framework.md](../guides/testing_framework.md), [../guides/security_model.md](../guides/security_model.md), and [../guides/philosophy_ethics.md](../guides/philosophy_ethics.md) to adapt the stack within your community.
4. Consult the references for comparative models, roadmap planning, frequently asked questions, and index crosswalks.

## Stewardship Norms

- Changes SHALL include plain-language rationales and references.
- Each community SHOULD record decisions in a Transparency Record that is visible to the public.
- Public Attestation Steps SHALL happen before deploying any model-influenced service.
- Participation feedback SHALL be summarized and linked to mandate updates.

## Document Status

This civic edition is evolving. Contributions are welcomed through transparent discussion, respectful critique, and careful documentation that honors the public-interest mission.
