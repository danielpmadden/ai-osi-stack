Update Plan 6 (Optional Integration & Adoption Framework)
“The edition that can plug in anywhere—when ready.”
1 · Purpose

To provide a modular, fill-in-the-blanks integration framework that lets external teams build their own AEIP validators, APIs, and automation pipelines without altering canonical content.
This plan defines how integration could work, while leaving implementation open.

2 · Scope

All modules described here are optional reference templates.
Custodians, enterprises, or regulators MAY implement any subset provided that:

Canonical clauses, AEIP schemas, and integrity records remain unchanged.

Implementation artifacts identify themselves as derived, non-canonical modules until signed by the custodian.

3 · Optional Machine-Readable Interfaces
Module	Format	Location	Status	Implementation Notes
AEIP JSON-LD Schemas	JSON-LD	/schemas/jsonld/	Scaffold provided	Developers may extend with local fields.
OpenAPI 3.1 Spec	YAML	/api/openapi.yaml	Template only	Add endpoints for validate, ledger/query.
GraphQL Schema	.graphql	/api/schema.graphql	Stub	Define resolvers as needed.
SPDX Metadata	JSON	/metadata/spdx.json	Placeholder	Update license and provenance per jurisdiction.
Ontology / RDF (OWL)	TTL	/ontology/aiosi.ttl	Draft	Map local vocabularies to canonical layers.
4 · Optional Executable Artifacts
4.1 Validator CLI / SDK Template

Reference stub: aiosi-cli
Functions: validate, sign, explain
Implementation teams may supply language bindings (Python, TS, Go, Java).

4.2 Docker Container (Reference Blueprint)

A minimal Dockerfile and entrypoint are provided as scaffolds.

Example – fill with local paths or tools
FROM python:3.12-slim
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.title="AI OSI Validator Template"
COPY schemas/ /app/schemas/
COPY tools/validator_stub.py /app/
ENTRYPOINT ["python","/app/validator_stub.py"]


Usage Example

docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data aiosi/validator validate /data/example.json


Implementers MAY replace the stub validator or add additional AEIP checks.
The canonical repository only maintains hash-verified container metadata fields for reference.

5 · System-Integration Guidelines (Non-Binding)

CI/CD Pipelines: Integrators may call local validator containers as a pre-merge hook.

Dashboards: Transparency Tier data MAY be fetched via REST endpoints.

Data Provenance Tools: Map AEIP → W3C PROV using custom translators.

Cloud Compliance: Terraform examples MAY embed the validator image.

6 · Developer & Adopter Scaffolds

CLI Stub – empty methods, ready for local logic.

Web Validator Mock-up – HTML template under /docs/demo/.

Verification Badge Template – static SVGs in /badges/.

Governance Simulator Notebook – placeholders in /notebooks/.

Quick-Adopt Pack – folder structure and documentation outlines.

7 · Adoption Infrastructure Templates
Audience	Optional Implementation
Governments / Regulators	Mirror canonical PDF + validator container for pilot use.
Academia / Standards Bodies	Extend ontology and submit PRs.
Enterprises	Customize Quick-Adopt Pack with local controls.
Open-Source Projects	Reference AEIP schema link in CONTRIBUTING.md.
8 · Compatibility and Evolution

Version headers remain fixed ($schemaVersion: 4.2).

Future modules MAY appear under /v4.3-draft/.

Migration script aiosi-migrate provided as pseudocode only.

9 · Governance Considerations

Optional modules SHALL remain non-normative until formally adopted.

Custodians MAY sign third-party modules into canonical status after audit.

Each external implementation SHOULD maintain its own Integrity Ledger entry referencing the canonical DOI.

10 · Implementation Roadmap (Indicative)

Populate placeholder schemas with field names.

Release reference Dockerfile & stub CLI.

Publish example OpenAPI + Swagger UI mock-server.

Invite community implementations; collect results via Meta-Audit.

Evaluate for inclusion in v 4.3 (full integration).

11 · Change-Log Entry (Appendix C)

v 4.2 — Integration & Adoption Framework (Optional Modules Edition, Dec 2025)
Added non-binding templates for JSON-LD schemas, API specifications, SDKs, and containerized validators.
These scaffolds enable rapid third-party adoption while keeping the canonical standard unchanged.
Future releases may elevate successful modules to normative status.

12 · Outcome

After Update Plan 6 (Optional Edition), The AI OSI Stack v 4.2 provides:

Dimension	Status
Technical	Optional JSON-LD / API / Container templates ready for extension
Operational	Validator CLI stubs and Docker blueprint available
Adoption	Quick-Adopt Pack and integration guides published
Continuity	Canonical hashes preserved; external builds self-declare non-canonical
Future Growth	All scaffolds upgradable to full modules in v 4.3
