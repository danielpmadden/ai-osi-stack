# AI OSI Stack v5.0 Frequently Asked Questions

**1. Is this a technical standard or a policy framework?**  
Both. The Stack combines enforceable policy obligations with the technical schemas and lifecycle controls needed to prove adoption. Each chapter cites AEIP artefacts, making it possible to satisfy regulatory requirements while implementing operational safeguards.

**2. Who maintains the Stack?**  
The Stack is stewarded by the Civic Stack Collective, an open consortium of public sector technologists, civic advocates, and academic partners. Governance changes are logged through the integrity ledger and announced via Appendix C and Appendix G procedures.

**3. How can enterprises adopt it?**  
Enterprises map their existing governance assets onto the Stack’s layers, then populate AEIP templates, persona registries, and semantic ledgers. The fact sheet and AEIP chapter provide onboarding checklists and transfer guidance for complex portfolios.

**4. What makes it auditable?**  
Every obligation references a concrete artefact—model cards, decision rationale records, oversight memos, integrity ledger entries, and more. The repository includes a `tools/integrity-check.py` script and manifest hashes so third parties can independently verify materials.

**5. Why are semantics and intimacy part of AI governance?**  
Language and relational design shape public trust. Chapters 20 and 21 treat rhetoric and companionship as governance issues, requiring semantic registries, persona manifests, and clinical credential verification to prevent manipulation or abuse.

**6. How does this differ from corporate AI “ethics boards”?**  
The Stack embeds accountability into operational tooling rather than relying on advisory committees. Obligations are enforceable, evidenced, and contestable by communities, with remediation pathways spelled out in appendices and schemas.

**7. Does the Stack cover human oversight requirements in the EU AI Act?**  
Yes. Layers 4 through 7 specify control, monitoring, and publication duties that align with Articles 14 and 23. The interpretive canon extends those duties to semantics, personas, and therapy contexts where human judgment is critical.

**8. What if our organisation already follows ISO/IEC 42001?**  
The Stack complements ISO/IEC 42001 by providing civic legitimacy, interpretive governance, and AEIP evidence structures. Organisations can map ISO controls to Stack layers to close gaps in participation, semantics, and persona accountability.

**9. How are updates governed?**  
Amendments are recorded in the integrity ledger, summarised via governance decision summaries, and subjected to participation procedures. The epilogue explains how the Stack functions as a living constitution with transparent ratification.

**10. Where can the public see real-world usage?**  
Pilot implementations and public attestations are catalogued in Appendix N and the governance spine repository. The press kit’s media assets include placeholders for linking to municipal deployments and future case studies.
