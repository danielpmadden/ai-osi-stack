# AI OSI Stack v5.0: A Public Architecture for Accountable AI

The AI OSI Stack is the open, civic operating system for governing automated systems. Version 5.0 arrives at a moment when publics, regulators, and enterprises are demanding proof that AI deployments can be trusted. The Stack answers that need with a layered constitution that connects policy, engineering practice, and community oversight. Every clause is paired with evidence requirements, giving governments and organisations a ready-made way to show how they meet the EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001, and allied standards.

Version 5.0 is the culmination of three years of hearings, pilot programmes, and iterative audits with partner cities, national regulators, and frontline advocacy groups. The new release introduces a Triple Register inside each chapter so readers see, in plain language, the human problem addressed, the normative clauses that resolve it, and a summary that any resident can understand. The canon spans Layers 0 through 8—civic mandate, ethical charter, data stewardship, model development, instruction and control, reasoning exchange, governance publication, and civic participation—before advancing into the interpretive chapters that examine rhetoric, persona design, therapy technology, and paradox resolution. Each section points directly to AEIP artefacts, persona registries, semantic ledgers, and other schemas so conformance can be measured and audited.

Highlights include:

* **Layer advancements.** Every core layer now references its governance artefacts, from civic charter schemas to instruction logs and deployment decision records. Strategic resilience (Layer 16) and meta-audit operations (Layer 17) provide detailed playbooks for crises and self-accountability, helping teams satisfy continuous improvement requirements.
* **Interpretive canon enrichment.** Chapters 19A through 24 expand on usage and trust, rhetoric and semantics, the companion trap, persona architecture, therapy technology, and governance paradoxes. They translate complex ethical tensions into enforceable controls and link them to credential verification, semantic registries, and oversight memos.
* **Assurance integration.** The Assurance Evidence Integration Platform (AEIP) chapter has been rebuilt to guide cross-jurisdiction adoption. It aligns lifecycle checkpoints, AEIP templates, and audit hand-offs, making it easier to deliver verifiable compliance bundles to regulators and procurement offices.

The release also ships with a public integrity check, updated schema cross-references, audits for every chapter, and a readability export for accessibility reviews. The new press kit supplies a fact sheet, FAQs, and media placeholders to help governments and enterprises brief their stakeholders quickly. All materials honour the Stack’s principle: civic legitimacy, technical precision, and legal accountability must move together.
