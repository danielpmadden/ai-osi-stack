# AI OSI Stack v5.0 Fact Sheet

## What is the AI OSI Stack?
- A layered, open governance architecture that binds civic mandates, engineering practice, and legal accountability for automated systems.
- Built to satisfy EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001, OECD AI Principles, and allied regulatory frameworks through verifiable artefacts.
- Delivered as a public reference implementation with schemas, audits, and operational guidance.

## Layers 0–8 Overview
- **Layer 0 – Civic Mandate:** Records the democratic licence and remediation triggers for any AI deployment.
- **Layer 1 – Ethical Charter:** Converts values into enforceable obligations with change logs and semantic alignment.
- **Layer 2 – Data Stewardship:** Governs collection, retention, and incident response for all data assets.
- **Layer 3 – Model Development:** Requires model cards, rationale records, and sandbox gating before release.
- **Layer 4 – Instruction and Control:** Audits prompts, command channels, and contested instruction sessions.
- **Layer 5 – Reasoning Exchange:** Preserves dialogue trails and governance summaries for deliberative transparency.
- **Layer 6 – Deployment and Integration:** Documents go-live decisions, safeguards, and incident escalation plans.
- **Layer 7 – Governance Publication:** Standardises how decisions and oversight findings reach the public record.
- **Layer 8 – Civic Participation:** Tracks engagement, feedback integration, and inclusive participation evidence.

## Interpretive Chapters
| Chapter | Focus | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| 19A | Usage and Trust | Shows how communities enforce usage covenants and restitution pathways. |
| 20 | Rhetoric and Semantics | Guards against semantic drift and discloses AI-assisted communications. |
| 21 | Companion Trap | Defines safeguards for relational AI and clinician oversight. |
| 22 | Persona Architecture | Manages persona roles, approvals, and stewardship boundaries. |
| 23 | Therapy Tech & Governance of Care | Aligns therapeutic AI with credential verification and incident response. |
| 24 | Governance Paradox | Balances automation assistance with accountable human decision-making. |

## Governance Highlights
- **Assurance Evidence Integration Platform (AEIP):** Updated lifecycle checkpoints and schema crosswalks for regulators and procurement offices.
- **Semantic Integrity:** Expanded semantic registry guidance and interpretive trace packages for rhetoric and knowledge governance.
- **Persona Architecture:** Manifests and registries that define the limits of synthetic and human personas across layers.
- **Therapy-Tech Safeguards:** Credential verification, incident reporting, and care-specific oversight protocols.
- **Meta-Governance:** Strategic resilience, meta-audit procedures, and temporal continuity to ensure the Stack remains a living constitution.

## How to Verify Adoption
- Review the current [Integrity Notice](../meta/INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md) for SHA-512 attestations and manifest references.
- Inspect `meta/v5-manifest.yaml` and AEIP templates for system-level evidence bundles.
- Re-run `tools/integrity-check.py` and compare output with published hashes to confirm provenance.
