# Layer 01 — Physical Compute Substrate

## Overview
This section outlines the normative controls and requirements for physical compute substrate. Detailed clauses will be developed in alignment with Version 5 governance directives.

## Key Objectives
- Establish measurable obligations.
- Maintain alignment with the civic mandate.
- Provide traceability to the v4→v5 crosswalk.

## Normative Clauses

### Clause L01-C001 — Sovereign Hardware Inventory
**Charter Reference:** Civic Legitimacy  
**AEIP Pointer:** aeip.layer01.hardware.inventory

Custodial operators SHALL maintain an auditable inventory of all sovereign hardware assets supporting civic workloads. Each inventory update MUST transmit an AEIP envelope referencing Clause L01-C001 to confirm public stewardship.

### Clause L01-C002 — Data Center Access Safeguards
**Charter Reference:** Rights and Protections  
**AEIP Pointer:** aeip.layer01.hardware.access

Physical access to civic compute facilities MUST enforce multifactor verification and community observer logs. Incident reports SHALL cite Clause L01-C002 within AEIP attestations to preserve accountability for rights protections.

### Clause L01-C003 — Sustainability Thresholds
**Charter Reference:** Participatory Renewal  
**AEIP Pointer:** aeip.layer01.hardware.sustainability

Sustainability metrics for civic compute operations SHALL be co-published with charter renewal packets. AEIP payloads referencing Clause L01-C003 MUST document energy disclosures and community feedback commitments.
