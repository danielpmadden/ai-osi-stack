# Layer 03 — Model Development

## Overview
This section outlines the normative controls and requirements for model development. Detailed clauses will be developed in alignment with Version 5 governance directives.

## Key Objectives
- Establish measurable obligations.
- Maintain alignment with the civic mandate.
- Provide traceability to the v4→v5 crosswalk.

## Normative Clauses

### Clause L03-C001 — Civic Use Case Register
**Charter Reference:** Civic Legitimacy  
**AEIP Pointer:** aeip.layer03.model.useCases

Model development teams SHALL maintain a civic use case register enumerating approved purposes. AEIP design packets citing Clause L03-C001 MUST accompany every new use case submission.

### Clause L03-C002 — Participatory Risk Reviews
**Charter Reference:** Participatory Renewal  
**AEIP Pointer:** aeip.layer03.model.riskReview

Each model milestone SHALL include a participatory risk review session with civic observers, logged via AEIP envelopes referencing Clause L03-C002 to confirm deliberative inclusion.

### Clause L03-C003 — Dataset-to-Model Traceability
**Charter Reference:** Rights and Protections  
**AEIP Pointer:** aeip.layer03.model.traceability

Model lineage documentation MUST link training datasets to model checkpoints. AEIP attestations for deployments SHALL reference Clause L03-C003 to guarantee rights-preserving traceability.
