# Layers Directory Overview

This directory contains markdown snapshots for each governance layer before LaTeX integration.

Navigation tips:
- Follow numeric prefixes (00–24) to track the custodial stack sequence.
- Use `appendices/` for extended references and crosswalks linked from each layer.
- Refer to `source/chapters/` for the LaTeX counterparts after editorial consolidation.

> Authored and maintained solely by the Custodial Editorial Committee.
> This is a non-operational, publication-grade governance artifact.
> No AEIP runtime specs or machine-readable schemas are included.
