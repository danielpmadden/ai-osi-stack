# L1 Ethical Charter

## Purpose

Layer 1 translates the mandate into binding commitments, obligations, and safeguards. It SHALL protect rights, prevent harm, and define accountability pathways.

## Charter Components

| Component | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **Values Statement** | Articulate principles such as dignity, fairness, and non-discrimination. |
| **Safeguards** | Enumerate protections for vulnerable communities and outline remediation triggers. |
| **Prohibited Practices** | List actions that SHALL NOT occur (e.g., unconsented surveillance, automated punitive decisions). |
| **Duty Holders** | Identify roles responsible for meeting charter commitments. |
| **Escalation Pathways** | Describe how grievances move from frontline staff to independent review. |

## Alignment Actions

1. Map each commitment to the civic mandate and document the linkage.
2. Establish training resources for staff and volunteers.
3. Coordinate with [L2 Data Stewardship](data_stewardship.md) to ensure data practices respect charter obligations.

## Oversight

- Charter updates SHALL undergo a Public Attestation Step via the Civic Oversight Interface.
- Annual charter reviews SHOULD include independent community auditors.
- Findings SHALL be recorded in the Transparency Record with clear remediation plans.

## Interface Summary

- Informs testing protocols in [../guides/testing_framework.md](../guides/testing_framework.md).
- Provides ethical constraints to [L3 Model Development](model_development.md) and [L4 Instruction Control](instruction_control.md).
