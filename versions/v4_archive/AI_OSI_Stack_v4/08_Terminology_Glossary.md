Title: 08_Terminology_Glossary.md
Version: v4.1-draft
Purpose: Define controlled terminology for the AI OSI Stack v4 reference architecture.
Status: Public reference (non-commercial)
---

## Purpose
This glossary establishes authoritative definitions for terms used across the AI OSI Stack v4 to ensure consistent interpretation.

## Scope
Definitions cover layers, artefacts, governance roles, and maturity references. Terms SHALL be used as defined to maintain interoperability and clarity.

## Status
Terminology is stable for v4.1-draft. Future proprietary extensions will add automation-specific terms while preserving baseline definitions.

## Key Points
- Controlled vocabulary prevents ambiguity across civic, ethical, and technical discussions.
- Terms MUST be referenced consistently across all documentation and artefacts.
- Proprietary terms are explicitly marked for future development and SHALL NOT be treated as part of the open reference.

## Glossary
- **AI OSI Stack**: A layered governance reference architecture aligning civic, ethical, fiduciary, and technical controls for AI systems.
- **AEIP (Accountability Evidence Integration Platform)**: A future proprietary automation layer designed to orchestrate evidence capture and verification. Not included in v4.1-draft.
- **Civic Charter**: Foundational mandate articulating societal purpose, authorizations, and obligations for an AI system.
- **Governance Control Tower**: Future proprietary oversight suite intended to coordinate AEIP outputs. Not included in v4.1-draft.
- **Governance Decision Record (GDR)**: Structured log capturing decisions, rationale, responsible roles, and evidence across layers.
- **Governance Dossier Set (GDS)**: Consolidated transparency artefacts for public and fiduciary reporting.
- **Incident Learning Exchange (ILE)**: Mechanism for collecting incidents, appeals, and community input, feeding improvements across layers.
- **Institutional Trust Profile (ITP)**: Baseline description of institutional mission, accountability obligations, and stakeholder commitments.
- **Operational Assurance Matrix (OAM)**: Control matrix documenting readiness, monitoring, and response criteria for deployment operations.
- **Reasoning Ledger**: Artefact capturing inference pathways, explanations, and contestability outcomes.
