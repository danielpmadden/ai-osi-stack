## Purpose
This document maps the primary audiences and use cases that SHOULD leverage the AI OSI Stack v4 to achieve accountable AI governance.

## Scope
Content includes institutional governance bodies, technical teams, civic watchdogs, and public interest groups. It also outlines cross-sector applications without naming specific organizations.

## Status
Use cases remain indicative. Institutions MAY tailor engagement models while preserving neutral language and adherence to Stack terminology. Proprietary automation remains forthcoming.

## Key Points
- The Stack supports oversight committees, fiduciary boards, technical assurance teams, and civic observers.
- Each audience SHOULD reference relevant layers and artefacts to meet accountability objectives.
- Collaboration across audiences MUST maintain transparency, documented decisions, and shared definitions.

## Primary Audiences and Applications
| Audience | Primary Needs | Relevant Layers | Key Artefacts |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Governance Boards | Verify civic mandate, ethical compliance, and fiduciary obligations. | L0–L2, L7 | ITP, Civic Charter, GDS |
| Risk & Compliance Leads | Assess operational risk, resilience, and assurance readiness. | L2–L6 | OAM, GDR, Control Playbooks |
| Technical Delivery Teams | Implement controls across data, model, and deployment workflows. | L2–L6 | Data Fiduciary Matrix, Model Evidence File, Integration Checklist |
