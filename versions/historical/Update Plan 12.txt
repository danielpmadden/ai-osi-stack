Update Plan 12 — AEIP Operational Annex Integration

“From Specification to Operation.”

1 · Purpose

To extend the AI OSI Stack v5 (Canonical Edition) with a complete, layer-by-layer operational annex for the AI Epistemic Infrastructure Protocol (AEIP) — turning its conceptual specification into a functional blueprint.
This plan defines how AEIP receipts are generated, signed, stored, and verified across all layers of the Stack, producing a consistent “reasoning audit trail” from hardware to governance publication.

2 · Objectives

Codify the full AEIP Receipts Lifecycle (event → record → ledger → audit → publication).

Define canonical schema examples for each layer (L0–L8).

Introduce CLI-level pseudocode for AEIP command operations.

Provide an Operational Diagram for data flow and custody.

Publish as a Normative Appendix (Appendix O) to the v5 specification and repository.

3 · Annex Title and Placement

Appendix O — AEIP Operational Annex (Lifecycle and Implementation Blueprint)
To appear immediately after Chapter 12 (“AEIP v1”) and before “Implementation and Verification Guidance.”

4 · Annex Structure
Section	Content Summary	Status
O.1 Purpose and Scope	Summarizes operational rationale and AEIP context within OSI layers.	New
O.2 Lifecycle Overview	Text + diagram showing five stages: Trigger → Receipt → Ledger → Audit → Publication.	New
O.3 Layer-by-Layer Mapping Table	One-row summary per layer: what generates the record, what metadata it carries, where it’s stored.	New
O.4 Canonical AEIP Record Template	JSON-LD header + justification + privacy + signature sections.	New
O.5 CLI / API Reference	Pseudocode for aeip log, aeip sign, aeip verify, aeip query.	New
O.6 Integrity and Storage Pathways	Describes ledger directories, hash chains, and timestamp proofs.	New
O.7 Verification and Audit Workflow	Querying, bundling, and exporting receipts into Decision Cards and Clarity Packages.	New
O.8 Implementation Notes	Vendor-neutral integration guidance (CLI, sidecar, or REST).	New
O.9 Expected Outcomes	Defines measurable deliverables: traceable reasoning, audit-ready ledgers, human-machine parity.	New
5 · Normative Requirements to Add

Receipt Generation Rule —
Each AI OSI Layer SHALL emit at least one AEIP-compliant Epistemic Exchange Unit (EEU) for every action with governance relevance.

Signature Rule —
All EEUs SHALL bear a cryptographic signature from the issuing persona or subsystem and at least one verifying entity.

Ledger Rule —
All EEUs SHALL be archived within the Integrity Ledger under a versioned directory corresponding to their layer (e.g., /ledger/l4/).

Accessibility Rule —
Governance Publication (L7) MUST include a public index of non-sensitive receipts or their hashes.

Drift and Version Rule —
Receipts MAY be re-issued only under new semantic-version identifiers; older hashes remain immutable.

9 · Change-Log Entry

v5.1 — AEIP Operational Annex Edition (Dec 2025)
Added Appendix O detailing the full operational lifecycle of AEIP receipts across all AI OSI layers. Introduced canonical JSON-LD templates, CLI pseudocode, and governance verification procedures enabling executable reasoning audits. Marks transition from conceptual specification to operational standard.

10 · Outcome

After Plan 12 integration:

AEIP becomes a working protocol, not just a paper schema.

Each AI OSI layer produces verifiable “receipts of reasoning.”

Custodians can trace every decision through cryptographic provenance.

Auditors and civic readers gain transparent, queryable evidence trails.

The Stack matures into a live governance operating system.
