Update Plan 9 (“Formal Alignment & Recognition Pathways Edition”)
“Substance earns trust; structure earns recognition.”
1 · Purpose

To establish formal recognition pathways between the AI OSI Stack and major regulatory, ethical, and technical frameworks — especially EU AI Act, GDPR, EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF, and ENISA AI Security Guidance.
This update converts compatibility into documented conformance through crosswalks, consistency matrices, and verifiable attestation templates.

2 · Objectives

Translate existing substantive alignment into documented, auditable equivalence.

Create modular “bridges” to recognized standards and directives.

Define conformance classes and attestation templates for future third-party audits.

Expand governance transparency into formal recognition without losing independence.

Ensure every mapping preserves human-rights safeguards codified in Update Plan 8.

3 · Current Alignment Snapshot
Category	Current Status	Alignment Mode
EU AI Act	Layers 5-7 & AEIP artifacts already implement Annex IV-style logs, reasoning traces, rollback controls.	Substantive
EU Charter (Arts 7, 8, 11, 21, 47)	Right-to-Opacity, Dual-Transparency, audit & grievance traces.	Rights consistency
GDPR	Consent, minimization, retention, provenance & deletion tombstones in Layer 2.	Principle-level
NIST AI RMF 1.0	Govern–Map–Measure–Manage parity via Heartwood & SEEDS.	Conceptual
ISO/IEC 42001	Management-system mapping through Governance Maps, maturity ladders, cadence metrics.	Structural
OECD / UNESCO AI Principles	Transparency, accountability, oversight & participation (Layers 4, 7, 8).	Substantive
W3C PROV-O	Direct JSON-LD interoperability via AEIP provenance registry.	Technical
4 · Formal Alignment Gaps

No harmonized-standard status under EU AI Act.

No third-party certification under ISO/IEC 42001 or 23894.

No published Annex IV crosswalk mapping each field to Stack evidence.

No Charter/GDPR matrix connecting rights → clauses.

No Security Controls Bridge to ENISA/ISO 27001.

No liability-evidence mapping for AI Liability Directive.

5 · Alignment Pathways (Quick-Action Roadmap)
Step	Deliverable	Description
1	Annex IV Crosswalk	Two-column table mapping each EU AI Act Annex IV item → AI OSI artifact or AEIP record (e.g., Model Card, Instruction Log, Incident Report).
2	EU Rights Consistency Matrix	Map EU Charter Articles 7, 8, 11, 21, 47 + GDPR principles → specific Stack clauses (Right-to-Opacity, Dual-Transparency, Proportionality Tests, Opt-In/Out).
3	Security Controls Bridge	Align Layer 1–6 controls with ISO 27001 Annex A and ENISA AI security domains (identity, logging, model integrity, supply chain).
4	Conformance Classes & Attestation	Define: • Class A (High-Risk): Layers 0-7 + AEIP 1.3 + HR clauses. • Class B (Moderate): Layers 2-7 + basic AEIP. • Class C (Low): Layers 2-5 only. Provide self-attestation + auditor checklist templates.
5	Liability Bridge Note	Document how AEIP ledger + SIR records preserve evidence for AI Liability Directive rebuttable-presumption clauses.

New drop-ins for /docs/:

/docs/Annex-IV-Crosswalk.md

/docs/EU-Charter-GDPR-Consistency-Matrix.md

/docs/Security-Controls-Bridge.md

/docs/Conformance-Classes-and-Attestation-Template.md

/docs/Liability-Bridge-Note.md

All carry normative tags ([Normative Appendix]) and version signatures under the Integrity Ledger.

7 · Custodial Charter Updates

Add “Alignment & Recognition” chapter to meta/INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md.

Require external crosswalks to preserve Right-to-Opacity from Update 8.

When future CEN/CENELEC harmonization is sought, maintain open-standard licensing (CC BY-SA 4.0).

8 · Implementation Timeline
Phase	Timeline	Output
1	+3 weeks	Draft Annex IV Crosswalk + EU Matrix for repo commit.
2	+6 weeks	Publish Security Bridge + Conformance Classes.
3	+8 weeks	Release self-attestation templates + Liability Bridge.
4	+10 weeks	Zenodo snapshot v 4.2.9 “Formal Alignment Edition.”
9 · Change-Log Entry

v 4.2.9 – Formal Alignment & Recognition Edition (March 2026)
Introduced Update Plan 9 establishing formal alignment with EU AI Act, GDPR, EU Charter, ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF, and ENISA security guidance. Added Annex IV Crosswalk, Rights Consistency Matrix, Security Controls Bridge, and Conformance Classes with self-attestation templates. Extended custodial charter to support external recognition while preserving the “Transparency ≠ Surveillance” principle from Update 8.

10 · Outcome

OSI Stack becomes verifiably interoperable with global frameworks.

Auditors gain ready-made mapping tools.

Human-rights clauses remain mandatory in all conformance classes.

Path opened toward future ISO/CEN/CENELEC recognition without sacrificing independence.

Documentation pack ready for publication and regulatory referencing.
