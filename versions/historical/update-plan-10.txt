Update Plan 10
“Nothing missing, nothing hidden.”

Implementation Closure & Compliance Hardening Edition

1 · Purpose

To complete the operational, documentary, and conformance deliverables mandated by Update Plans 8 and 9 and lock AI OSI v 4.2 into a fully auditable, compliance-ready baseline.
This update closes residual gaps in privacy schema publication, bridge documentation, civic-oversight specification, and canonical embedding of the non-revocable human-rights principle.

2 · Objectives

Publish all missing normative artifacts (Appendix N, AEIP 1.3 schema, Civic Oversight Interface, and five Plan 9 bridge files).

Embed the human-rights and non-revocable interpretive principle into Preface, Glossary, and Integrity Notice.

Deliver a working privacy-conformance validator and CLI test harness.

Finalize and sign the new files for repository integrity and Zenodo v 4.2.10 snapshot.

Declare v 4.2.10 the canonical closure of the 4.x branch prior to federation and ISO/CEN submission.

3 · Normative Deliverables
Category	File	Purpose
AEIP v 1.3 JSON-LD Schema	/schemas/aeip-1.3.jsonld	Adds privacy.scope, privacy.consent, privacy.redaction, privacy.justification; required for Update 8 compliance.
Appendix N – Human Rights Safeguards	/appendices/Appendix-N-Human-Rights-Safeguards.md	Normative appendix embedding Right-to-Opacity, Dual-Transparency, Audit-Cycle Cap, Proportional-Access Principle, and interpretive quote.
Civic Oversight Interface Spec	/docs/Civic-Oversight-Interface-Layer8.md	Defines attestation protocol, signer roles, hashed receipts, and zero-knowledge confirmation flow for civil-society audits.
Annex IV Crosswalk	/docs/Annex-IV-Crosswalk.md	EU AI Act Annex IV → AI OSI artifacts mapping.
EU Rights & GDPR Consistency Matrix	/docs/EU-Charter-GDPR-Consistency-Matrix.md	Charter Articles 7, 8, 11, 21, 47 → specific clauses and AEIP fields.
Security Controls Bridge	/docs/Security-Controls-Bridge.md	Links Layers 1–6 controls to ISO 27001 Annex A & ENISA AI Security domains.
Conformance Classes & Attestation	/docs/Conformance-Classes-and-Attestation-Template.md	Defines Class A/B/C criteria and self-attestation / audit checklists.
Liability Bridge Note	/docs/Liability-Bridge-Note.md	Explains how AEIP ledgers preserve evidence for EU AI Liability Directive presumptions.
Privacy Conformance Validator Tool	/tools/privacy-conformance-cli.py	Parses AEIP artifacts → fail if consent/metadata absent; logs reasons.
Preface & Glossary Edits	Main spec & GLOSSARY.md	Insert non-revocable principle: “Transparency must never become surveillance.”
Integrity Notice Update	INTEGRITY_NOTICE.md	Add “Human-Rights Baseline” section and new SHA512 hashes.
4 · Normative Rules Added

Conformance Rejection Rule — AEIP validators MUST reject any artifact lacking consent or privacy metadata.

Civil-Society Attestation Rule — Layer 8 implementations SHALL support at least one external cryptographic attestation from a registered oversight actor.

Interpretive Principle Embedding — The phrase “Transparency must never become surveillance.” is permanent, non-revocable, and appears in Preface §0, Glossary, and Appendix N.

Human-Rights Baseline Verification — Integrity Notice SHALL list Appendix N and AEIP 1.3 hashes as required evidence for any canonical release.

5 · Implementation Steps
Phase	Timeline	Deliverable
1	+2 weeks	Publish AEIP 1.3 schema & privacy-validator CLI.
2	+3 weeks	Release Appendix N + Civic Oversight Interface spec.
3	+5 weeks	Publish five Plan 9 bridge docs.
4	+6 weeks	Preface/Glossary/Integrity Notice patch and sign.
5	+8 weeks	Mint Zenodo snapshot v 4.2.10 (“Implementation Closure Edition”).
6 · Verification and Testing

Run privacy-validator on all sample AEIP artifacts; repository tests MUST fail without required fields.

Validate civic-oversight attestations via hashed receipt samples.

Regenerate PDF and confirm Preface/Glossary inclusion of principle text.

GPG-sign all new Markdown and JSON-LD files; update hash ledger.

7 · Change-Log Entry

v 4.2.10 – Implementation Closure & Compliance Hardening Edition (Apr 2026)
Completed all missing Update 8 and 9 deliverables. Added AEIP v 1.3 schema and privacy validator; published Appendix N (Human Rights Safeguards) and Civic Oversight Interface; embedded non-revocable interpretive principle in Preface and Glossary; issued Annex IV Crosswalk, Rights Matrix, Security Bridge, Conformance Classes, and Liability Note. This release closes all 4.x compliance requirements and establishes the canonical baseline for future harmonization and ISO/CEN submission.

8 · Outcome

All mandated human-rights, privacy, and oversight mechanisms exist in signed, machine-readable form.

EU and international alignment fully documented.

Repository passes privacy-validator and self-audit tests.

v 4.2 branch becomes complete, immutable baseline for federation (v 5).
