Update Plan 11 — Canonical Consolidation & Version 5 Declaration

“All roads lead to v5.”

1 · Purpose

This plan formally consolidates every prior update (Plans 1–10, v 4.2.1 – v 4.2.10) into a single major release:

AI OSI Stack v5 (Canonical Edition)

It retires the 4.x naming scheme and establishes v5 as the sole active, authoritative version going forward.

2 · Background

v1–v2 (Sept 9 2025): Initial blog publication introducing the seven-layer AI OSI Stack.

v3 (Oct 31 2025): First full framework draft with persona integration.

v4 (Nov 2 2025): Normative Master Edition establishing the layered specification.

v 4.2.1 – v 4.2.10 (Nov 3–4 2025): Successive refinements covering semantic integrity, readability, custodial continuity, human-rights safeguards, and alignment artifacts.

Each of those incremental updates remains historically valid as part of the provenance chain but is now archived within v5.

3 · Canonical Transition
From	To	Action
v 4.2.1 – v 4.2.10	v5	Merged and finalized
AI OSI Stack v4 (Master Edition)**	Superseded	Retained for historical citation only
GitHub Repository	Continues as repository of record	Branch /v5 becomes main
Domain (aiosi.org)	Continues as domain of record	Hosts canonical release v5
4 · Canonical Declaration

AI OSI Stack v5 (2025-11-09)

Consolidates all prior refinements into one stable, custodially signed edition.

7 · Outcome

v5 is the current canonical specification of The AI OSI Stack.

All v 1–v 4.x releases are archived historical versions.

The update-plan era is officially closed.

Future developments (e.g., federation, ISO alignment, or AEIP v 2.0) will proceed under the v5 branch, not as new 4.x revisions.

8 · Closing Statement

AI OSI Stack v5 stands as the unified culmination of every preceding refinement.
All prior versions remain part of its verified lineage,
but the canonical torch now burns under a single name: Version 5.
