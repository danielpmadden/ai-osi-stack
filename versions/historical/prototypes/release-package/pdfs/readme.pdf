(## Overview) Tj
T*
(The AI OSI Stack v4 \(Expanded\) restores the canonical governance architecture developed by) Tj
T*
(Daniel P. Madden to unite technical controls, ethical guardrails, and institutional) Tj
T*
(accountability across the lifecycle of intelligent systems. The stack is the anchor of the) Tj
T*
(**AI Governance Trinity**  the synthesis of the AI OSI Stack, Persona Architecture,) Tj
T*
(Epistemology by Design, and the AI Epistemic Infrastructure Protocol \(AEIP\)  ensuring) Tj
T*
(that reasoning integrity, role accountability, and evidence generation advance together.) Tj
T*
(Version 4 reasserts the seven-layer architecture as a living bridge between compute) Tj
T*
(substrates, socio-technical oversight, and public legitimacy, explicitly binding) Tj
T*
(operational proof to normative commitments.) Tj
T*
T*
(The historical progression from v1 through v3 culminates here. **Version 1** established) Tj
T*
(the layered metaphor and introduced integrity ledgers for AI services. **Version 2**) Tj
T*
(expanded into Persona Architecture and affective constraint design, embedding role-) Tj
T*
(specific accountability. **Version 3** incorporated Epistemology by Design and AEIP) Tj
T*
(alignment, demonstrating how reasoning provenance could be transported as a protocol.) Tj
T*
(**Version 4 \(Expanded\)** consolidates these trajectories into a unified, jurisdiction-) Tj
T*
(neutral standard proposal that harmonizes global regulatory requirements with executable) Tj
T*
(governance.) Tj
T*
T*
(## Purpose and Scope) Tj
T*
(This repository serves simultaneously as a conceptual reference and an executable) Tj
T*
(demonstration environment. The v4 release integrates the prior frameworks  AI OSI,) Tj
T*
(Persona Architecture, Epistemology by Design, and AEIP  into one authoritative standard) Tj
T*
(proposal. It provides policy architects, regulators, and technical stewards with a) Tj
T*
(coherent blueprint for designing, validating, and disclosing accountable AI systems. All) Tj
T*
(materials are delivered for offline study, conformance testing, and future adoption by) Tj
T*
(public institutions, private sector alliances, and multilateral governance bodies.) Tj

T*
(### AI OSI Protocol Stack v4  Blueprint Implementation) Tj
T*
(The **Blueprint Integration Release** introduces a structured codebase generated by the) Tj
T*
(master prompt build to illustrate how the AI OSI Stack can operate as a self-contained) Tj
T*
(governance engine. Key directories include:) Tj
T*
T*
(- `/protocol/`  AEIP transport engine, governance ledger node, registry services, and) Tj
T*
(deterministic test vectors.) Tj
T*
(- `/schemas/`  machine-readable artifact definitions for Interpretive Trace Packages) Tj
T*
(\(ITP\), Decision Rationale Records \(DRR\), Governance Disclosure Statements \(GDS\), Oversight) Tj
T*
(Action Memoranda \(OAM\), and Integrity Ledger Entries \(ILE\).) Tj
T*
(- `/src/layer18/`  layer-aligned modules, validators, and persona integration hooks) Tj
T*
(spanning the full seven-layer stack plus the optional civic mandate layer.) Tj
T*
(- `/tools/`  command-line utilities for artifact generation, signature rehearsal, and) Tj
T*
(schema validation.) Tj
T*
(- `/tests/`  conformance and handshake verification suites covering AEIP flows, ledger) Tj
T*
(provenance, and schema contracts.) Tj
T*
(- `/examples/`  Jupyter notebooks demonstrating single-node and multi-node reasoning) Tj
T*
(handshakes, ledger replay, and governance council exercises.) Tj
T*
T*
(This blueprint is an **offline-first reference implementation**. It demonstrates how) Tj
T*
(governance can be instantiated as executable code, enabling reproducible testing without) Tj
T*
(active networks. The implementation SHALL NOT be interpreted as a production network or a) Tj
T*
(live compliance service.) Tj
T*
T*
(### Key Features) Tj
T*
(- **AEIP v1 Handshake:** Implements the five-step reasoning exchange \(`Intent  Justify ) Tj
T*
(CounterSign  Commit  Update`\) with deterministic fixtures.) Tj
T*
(- **Governance Ledger and Temporal Integrity:** Provides a local append-only ledger with) Tj
T*
(temporal validity windows and replayable provenance.) Tj
T*
(- **Conformance Assurance:** Ships schema validators, artifact provenance checks, and) Tj
T*
(handshake integrity tests to verify adherence to the canonical specifications.) Tj
T*
(- **Offline Execution:** Operates without external dependencies, emphasizing audit) Tj
T*
(reproducibility and jurisdiction-neutral deployment.) Tj
T*
T*
(### Purpose) Tj
T*
(> This blueprint exists to demonstrate that governance itself can be executable  that) Tj
T*
(reasoning, provenance, and accountability can move through a stack with the same rigor as) Tj
T*
(data.) Tj
T*
T*
(## Project Status and Contribution Policy) Tj
T*
(The AI OSI Stack is maintained by a single independent researcher and released for) Tj
T*
(reference, study, and future standardization. No active APIs, databases, or live network) Tj
T*
(services are deployed. Forks, translations, and policy adaptations are welcome under the) Tj
