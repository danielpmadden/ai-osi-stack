(## 1. Design Philosophy  Design Now, Instantiate Later) Tj
T*
(The AI OSI Stack operates as a governance-first reference implementation. Architectural) Tj
T*
(intent is finalized in this blueprint; operational deployment is deferred until custodial) Tj
T*
(councils confirm readiness. Each module, schema, and artifact is engineered to demonstrate) Tj
T*
(how stewardship evidence MAY be produced, validated, and archived. Implementers SHALL) Tj
T*
(treat the codebase as a canonical rehearsal environment rather than a production network.) Tj
T*
T*
(## 2. Offline-Only Execution Constraints) Tj
T*
(All tooling, tests, and examples SHALL execute without network access. Offline execution) Tj
T*
(preserves audit reproducibility, protects unfinished persona credentials, and prevents) Tj
T*
(accidental data egress. Where integrations with external systems are envisioned \(e.g.,) Tj
T*
(Persona-PKI, Open Governance Registry\), the repository provides placeholders and schema) Tj
T*
(contracts only. Operators SHALL stage integrations in isolated sandboxes and SHALL NOT) Tj
T*
(connect this blueprint to live infrastructure without explicit custodial authorization.) Tj
T*
T*
(## 3. Artifact Integrity and Temporal Governance) Tj
T*
(Schemas within `/schemas/` and validation logic under `/tests/` enforce deterministic) Tj
T*
(hashing, temporal seals, and cross-layer traceability. Generated artifacts SHALL include) Tj
T*
(SHA3-512 fingerprints, persona identifiers, and timestamps bound to UTC. Temporal) Tj
T*
(legitimacy reviews MAY be rehearsed using the provided ledger utilities; actual regulatory) Tj
T*
(submissions SHALL reference the canonical documents in `/source/` and `/docs/`.) Tj

(## 4. Authorship Statement) Tj
T*
(All original research, specifications, and blueprint logic remain authored by **Daniel P.) Tj
T*
(Madden**. This repository is released to preserve the canonical architecture for future) Tj
