(> ## Normative Language Notice) Tj
T*
(> This document uses normative language consistent with ISO/IEC 42010 and NIST) Tj

(## 1. Purpose and Relationship to AEIP) Tj
T*
(The AI OSI Stack defines a seven-layer governance architecture that binds technical) Tj
T*
(controls, institutional stewardship, and evidentiary accountability. It functions as the) Tj
T*
(canonical scaffold for the **AI Epistemic Infrastructure Protocol \(AEIP\)**, which provides) Tj
T*
(the transport layer that conveys reasoning states, decisions, and temporal attestations) Tj
T*
(between personas, auditors, and custodial nodes. AEIP inherits the stacks normative) Tj
T*
(guardrailsreasoning fidelity, traceable accountability, and dignity-first) Tj
T*
(commitmentswhile supplying deterministic handshakes that keep each layers artifacts) Tj
T*
(synchronized.) Tj
T*
T*
(## 2. Seven-Layer Design Summary) Tj
T*
(The blueprint encompasses seven mandatory governance layers \(with an optional civic) Tj
T*
(mandate precursor\). Each layer exposes interfaces, controls, and evidence channels that) Tj
T*
(align with AEIP packet classes.) Tj

(## 3. Ethical Foundations) Tj
T*
(The stacks structure codifies Daniel P. Maddens ethical triad:) Tj
T*
(1. **Dignity by Design**  Personas, affect controls, and refusal logic maintain human) Tj
T*
(primacy and avert manipulative behaviors.) Tj
T*
(2. **Epistemic Integrity**  Interpretive Trace Packages \(ITP\) and Decision Rationale) Tj
T*
(Records \(DRR\) ensure reasoning is reconstructable and contestable.) Tj
T*
(3. **Accountable Stewardship**  Integrity Ledger Entries \(ILE\) and Governance Disclosure) Tj
T*
(Statements \(GDS\) expose temporally sealed evidence to auditors and the public.) Tj
T*
T*
(## 4. Offline-First Blueprint Scope) Tj
T*
(This reference implementation is intentionally **offline-first**. All utilities, schemas,) Tj
T*
(and example ledgers SHALL operate without network dependencies to guarantee reproducible) Tj
T*
(review, audit rehearsals, and archival resilience. Deployment, live registries, and) Tj
T*
(production key material are **out of scope**. Stakeholders SHALL treat this repository as) Tj
T*
(a normative blueprint: design decisions are finalized, but instantiation in live) Tj
T*
(infrastructure remains deferred until governance coalitions ratify operational) Tj
T*
(requirements.) Tj
T*
T*
(## 5. Integration Roadmap Considerations) Tj
T*
(Organizations adopting the AI OSI Stack SHALL first internalize the seven-layer) Tj
T*
(obligations, map existing controls to artifact expectations, and stage AEIP nodes in) Tj
T*
(sandbox form. Only after governance councils approve contextual adaptations SHOULD) Tj
T*
(production roll-out proceed. Continuous maturation follows the Implementation Maturity) Tj
T*
(Model described in the canonical specification, ensuring every escalation preserves the) Tj
T*
(ethical foundations summarized above.) Tj
