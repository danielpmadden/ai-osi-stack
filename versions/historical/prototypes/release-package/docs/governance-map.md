> ## Normative Language Notice
> This document uses normative language consistent with ISO/IEC 42010 and NIST conventions.

> Interpretations SHALL preserve authorial intent: layered accountability, epistemic integrity, and human dignity as binding design constraints.

## 1. Layer-to-Governance Control Matrix
| AI OSI Layer | Primary Governance Risks | Example Controls | Evidence Artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1 – Physical Substrate | Hardware tampering, supply chain opacity, resilience failure | Certified facility audits, redundant energy and cooling governance, tamper-evident custody | GDS, DRR |
| L2 – Data Stewardship | Consent erosion, provenance drift, epistemic contamination | Consent traceability ledgers, dataset review boards, epistemic hygiene playbooks | ITP, DRR |
| L3 – Model Development | Bias amplification, evaluation blind spots, red-team blind coverage | Composite evaluation harnesses, adversarial benchmarking cadences, persona-aligned regression suites | OAM, GDS |
| L4 – Instruction & Control | Prompt injection, persona drift, affect misalignment | Persona mandate enforcement, refusal logic penetration testing, affect boundary audits | ITP, DRR, GDS |
| L5 – Reasoning Exchange | Ledger desynchronization, packet replay, counter-signature gaps | AEIP handshake validation, deterministic replay checkpoints, cross-node quorum review | ILE, OAM |
| L6 – Deployment & Integration | Runtime drift, change conflicts, incident opacity | Change gating with governance approvals, blue/green stewardship protocols, incident rehearsal | TRR, OAM |
| L7 – Governance Publication | Delayed disclosure, accountability gaps, civic legitimacy erosion | Public disclosure cadence, multi-stakeholder review councils, archival notarization | GDS, ILE |

## 2. Stewardship Notes
Governance councils SHALL maintain the above matrix as a living register. Controls MAY be tailored to sectoral mandates provided equivalent rigor, transparency, and dignity-first obligations are preserved. Artifact classes SHALL remain immutable to ensure cross-layer auditability.
