# Machine-Learning Utilities

Lightweight, humanities-aligned analytics live here. Scripts prioritise interpretability over model performance and help auditors surface modality drift, schema duplication, and governance reporting gaps.

- `audit_text_analysis.py` — normative language pulse-check for Markdown and plain-text governance documents.
- `schema_coherence.py` — clusters schema field names to reveal redundant or drifting concepts.
- `report_generator.py` — assembles ML findings into markdown for publication under `audits/`.
- `requirements.txt` — pinned dependencies for reproducible local runs.
